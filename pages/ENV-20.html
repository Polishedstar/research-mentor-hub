            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the findings, it was discovered that all the selected economic restructuring policies have their respective level of implementation less than 50%. This is sending a wrong signal to the construction industry, since it was also discovered that the selected policies have significant effects on the construction industry.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, if all these policies can be given the needed implementation and other ones that are yet to be annexed are done, there will be rapid growth in the economy which will, in turn, translate to the construction industry. What the economy gives to the construction industry is what the industry will give back to the economy. When the economy is booming, construction activities will boom, and more unemployed graduates will be at their best, and the dream of housing for all will be easily achieved.</p>
