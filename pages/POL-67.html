            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Below are the summary of findings from the study:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The study showed that Local Government Committee System has an impact on the Local Government administration in improving the socio-economic aspect of the rural populace.</li>
                    <li>That effectiveness and efficiency of Local Government Committee System enhance the achievement of Jos South Local Government to achieve goals and objectives.</li>
                    <li>The study revealed that political interference affects Local Government Committee System in discharging its delegated functions to the local government.</li>
                    <li>The study further discovered that Local Government Committee System ensures speedy disposition of duties and responsibility at the local government.</li>
                    <li>The study stressed that decongestion of duties and responsibilities of the Local Government functions and responsibilities is the responsibility of Local Government Committee System.</li>
                    <li>It was revealed in the study that Local Government Committee System contributes to the upliftment and survival of Jos South Local Government.</li>
                    <li>That Local Government Committee System enhances socio-economic development of the local government.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that Local Government Committee System enhances effective management of finances in the local government.</li>
                    <li>The study portrayed that lack of supervision and management techniques by the Local Government Committee System affect the performance and administration of the local government council.</li>
                    <li>The study indicated that Local Government Committee System permits specialization among members.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered in the study that Local Government Committee System promotes effective sharing in decision-making and is thus the handmaiden of democracy.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is obvious that for the local governments to perform their duties and responsibilities effectively, there must be delegation of some of its several responsibilities to an authorized body that will decongest and perform some of the responsibilities and duties on its behalf. It is on this background that the Local Government Committee System comes to bear.</p>
                <p>Local Government Committee System has contributed a lot to the socio-economic development of Nigeria and administration of Local Government, having performed the delegated function greatly in the decongestion of local government responsibilities, saving of time, promoting effective sharing in decision-making, and serving as the handmaiden of democracy while encouraging specialization among members.</p>
