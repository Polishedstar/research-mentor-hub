            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This chapter presents the conclusion of the research on the usage of social media among journalists and media outlets in Ethiopia. Social media was the focus of this study because it is a global phenomenon that is bringing a global impact on several disciplines, of which the profession of journalism is at the forefront. The main findings and conclusions of the study are presented below:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The study reveals that, of course, there are digital divides; journalists in Ethiopia have embraced social media all in all. It is commonly used among predominantly male, young, and degree holder journalists in Ethiopia.</li>
                    <li>The most commonly used types of social media are Facebook, YouTube, and Google+, including Twitter and Wikipedia. The purpose of social media use among journalists in Ethiopia includes: to stay connected, to keep their mind active, for personal development, and to get well-timed information.</li>
                    <li>Journalists access the internet at the workplace to use social media both for personal and professional purposes. There is no demarcation between personal and professional use of it. Thus, they fall under the category of conformists.</li>
                    <li>The researcher observed that journalists have smartphones as well and it is common to see them bending their heads down using their smartphones. Relating to the nature of the platform; however, they are consumers of social media contents than providers, despite the fact that they are active users of social media who would access many times a day. Thus, it could be said that social media networks are a hangout for journalists in Ethiopia.</li>
                    <li>To meet friends, and chatting and entertaining are the popular activities journalists are adept at if they use social media for personal purposes.</li>
                    <li>Journalists regularly use social media to find and share news and information, to follow updates from media outlets, to find out what the people are talking about and to look for an idea for further use in their profession if they are to access social media for their job-related purpose. Nevertheless, they rarely use social media to engage with their audiences and to brand themselves.</li>
                    <li>More importantly, the infamous identity the Ethiopian journalists are known for - self-censorship - has followed journalists to the social media arena. There is a discourse of fear among journalists as a result of which they would choose to keep silent on the interactive platform.</li>
                    <li>Due to this, they have a fear of expressing themselves boldly and letting others react on the interactive sphere of social media, though they sometimes participate in trivial issues while ignoring critical issues.</li>
                    <li>Journalist’s trust in information on social media depends on the issue. They rated themselves that they have very good knowledge of social media and they use it regularly for journalistic purposes. Thus, they are active users of social media in such a way that it is important in their daily activity.</li>
                    <li>However, this does not mean that journalists are using social media for journalistic purposes exhaustively since it depends on the content, the interest and quality of the journalist, and the media institution the journalist is working at.</li>
                    <li>Especially due to stiff control they encountered at media institutions, journalists have developed a dual identity on social and mainstream media.</li>
                    <li>The media institutions in Ethiopia have a low orientation of using social media for journalism purposes. Media institutions are neither encouraging nor prohibiting openly journalists to utilize social media for journalistic purposes.</li>
                    <li>Notwithstanding the gap in the use of social media by media institutions, journalists partly agree that social media would help them foster the development and democracy role of media and improve media audience relationships.</li>
                    <li>What’s more is of all journalists a quarter of them had created a social media account with the name of their program or news; though, it is hardly known by the media institutions they are working in. This implies that the media industries have less attention to social media despite the fact that it can be budgeted and managed with low capital. This can be visible in the social media accounts of media institutions.</li>
                    <li>Although there are differences between media institutions, there are challenges of using social media wisely owing to knowledge, attitude, and factors like lack of attention. None of the media institutions has developed a social media editor and strategy so far, though there are moments in which journalists are fined their salary, demoted, and told not to write contents on social media that go against the contents of those media industries.</li>
