            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Banking is dynamic and it has evolved over the years, changing with development and the needs of society. In Nigeria, banking in its modern form started in 1892. Over the years, many scholars have written about the meaning of banking sector reform and bank consolidation, their causes, and the need for the reform, as seen in Chapter 2.</p>
                <p>The method used in the collection of data for this project work is classified into primary and secondary data. The steps taken in the preparation of this research are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determination of population</li>
                    <li>Selection of the method of data collection, which was the questionnaire</li>
                    <li>Selection of the measurement techniques, with percentages</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The questions were presented to bank staff and some to the banking public, and all were returned, analyzed, and interpreted.</p>
                <p>The research conducted has unveiled and given insight into the banking sector reform and bank consolidation. From the study undertaken, it shows that the majority of the banking public appreciate the banking sector reform and bank consolidation because there is an increase in loan facilities, i.e., most of the banking public have access to loans more than ever. It also shows that the reform has brought about positive changes in the economy. Since the inception of the reforms, the findings indicate that the banking industry has changed its business concepts to meet global banking challenges and is no longer solely reliant on the public.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the study reveals that the confidence of the customer has been restored because of the reforms and regulatory bodies. It also revealed that banks are facing positive challenges as a result of reform, although many lost their jobs due to mergers or acquisitions. However, such challenges enable them to invent new financial projects and strategies to withstand competitor banks.</p>
