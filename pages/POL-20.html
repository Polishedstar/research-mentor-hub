            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focused on corruption and public service delivery. It covers the background and the effect of corruption on Public Service Delivery. It also discussed corruption through the review of relevant literature. Questionnaires were distributed to selected respondents, and several findings were made. These findings include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Public servants are aware of the corrupt practices in the public service.</li>
                    <li>Corruption has negatively impacted our economic sector in the areas of development and effective service delivery.</li>
                    <li>The anti-corruption measures are inactive in carrying out their job, as the individuals involved in corrupt practices are not punished.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There is no doubt that the high rate of corruption in the public service has great implications for effective service delivery. This is because the public service is the major implementer of government policies and programs aimed at providing essential services that impact the well-being of the general citizenry.</p>
                <p>It is, however, unfortunate that the citizens who are supposed to enjoy the benefits of citizenship are ridiculed and frustrated. Public officials, for example, collect bribes from the citizens before granting them access to some services. Citizens are also often denied access to services they pay for (e.g., water, electricity, health, and other essential services).</p>
                <p>The principal-agent relationship, which is supposed to bring improvement to the well-being of the citizens, has instead brought about a degeneration in the quality of life of the citizenry. Thus, there is a symbiotic relationship between corruption in the public service and effective service delivery.</p>
