    <main>
        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
                <p>The study examined the effects of early marriage on the academic performance of female students in Nigeria, with a case study of Jos South Local Government Area. More specifically, the study sought to assess the educational and non-educational effects of early marriage on the academic performance of married female students in Nigeria, focusing on Jos South Local Government Area.</p>
            
                <p>The study adopted the purposive sampling technique to select 225 students across different academic levels and departments. A well-constructed questionnaire was developed to supply information on the subject matter, and the data collected were subjected to the statistical method of descriptive statistics. In furtherance, the chi-squared technique was employed to test the stated hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05.</p>
            
                <p>Findings from the study revealed that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>13 (7.1%) of the respondents are in Primary 1; 25 (13.7%) are in Primary 2, 67 (36.6%) are in Primary 3, 74 (40.4%) are in Primary 4.</li>
                    <li>Based on class division; 32 (17.5%) of the respondents are in pass, 64 (35.0%) are in lower credit; 73 (39.9%) are in upper credit, and 14 (7.7%) are in distinction.</li>
                    <li>Based on years in marriage, 83 (45.4%) of the respondents have spent between 1-3 years; 63 (34.4%) have spent between 4-6 years; 27 (14.8%) have spent 7-10 years, and 10 (5.5%) have spent above 10 years.</li>
                    <li>Poverty, unwanted pregnancy, religious injunctions, avoidance of shame and disgrace, parental pressure to avoid sexual relations outside marriage, financial challenges, prestige, limited education, limited job opportunities, and customs and traditions are the principal reasons for early marriage in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Early marriage has significant educational effects on respondents' academic achievement in terms of lack of concentration in class, poor class attendance, paucity of time to read and study, poor performance in tests and examinations, and difficulties to comprehend what is taught in class, among others.</li>
                    <li>Early marriage also has significant non-educational effects on respondents' academic achievement in terms of increased stress, increased frustration, emotional imbalance, widened burden of responsibilities, and low self-concept, among others.</li>
