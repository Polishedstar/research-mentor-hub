            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the results, the following discoveries have been made:</p>
                <p>A. Television programs can promote tourism. Television, as mentioned in the earlier chapters, is one of the fastest and most spectacular means of communication. Therefore, it has a great impact on society. Whatever message is conveyed on television can spread among the public rapidly. This provides evidence that television can play a role in the promotion of culture and tourism.</p>
                <p>News reporters also have a role in promoting culture and tourism by drawing the attention of the government to the development of cultural and tourist sites, especially the man-made areas. Information carries a significant message, depending on how it is packaged. If properly presented to the government, it can open their eyes to the importance of television in the promotion of culture in Plateau State.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the researcher has found that television plays a vital role in the promotion of culture and tourism in Plateau State through improved television programs such as drama documentaries, advertisements, and news reports. The government also has a role to play in this regard. However, since the government has neglected this aspect, it is the duty of television stations to serve as a reminder and emphasize the need for the government to address this situation.</p>
