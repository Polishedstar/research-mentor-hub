            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In establishing how ICT enhanced effective financial management in secondary schools in Plateau State, it was first revealed that 92% of the schools were using ICT in financial management. It was established that ICT tools in financial management were mostly used for balancing incomes and expenditures of the school but mostly with the use of Microsoft Excel. A few schools were fond of using programs like QuickBooks because they required much expertise. Also, electronic databases were used to manage teachers' payrolls, but it was revealed that advanced databases were hard to manage because they needed much expertise and were very expensive.</p>
                <p>Schools were much willing to use ICT facilities in financial management due to their accuracy and time-saving aspect related to them. This implied that school administrators knew the importance of using ICT but were hindered by inadequate computer skills and inaccessibility to all the required ICT facilities such as relevant databases.</p>
                <p>According to the survey, the most commonly used ICT structures in financial management-related issues included websites, computers, emails, and internet SMS, plus electronic databases. They were specifically used for record-keeping, monitoring school fees payment, procurement, salaries, and wages.</p>
                <p>On the effect of ICT on examination management; setting, testing, record-keeping, and grading system in secondary schools, results showed that computer applications such as Microsoft Word were used in setting exams, and Excel was mostly used in calculating and grading of students' performance. It was realized that there was an improvement in efficiency and tracking students' academic progress. Once students' results were entered into the database, grading could automatically be done, and a comparative analysis regarding performance could easily be generated. In such an aspect, the effect of ICT was recognized by teachers and administrators; however, the facilities were not widely applied in examination management. For record-keeping purposes, it was discovered that the use of electronic databases made it easier to verify students' payments, and they ensured error-free records.</p>
                <p>Computer applications like Excel were used in computing students' grades and by determining the pass mark. Administrators pointed out that after administering exams, all teachers are required to submit their marks to the database administrators for grading, and reports could automatically be printed out for every student. In conclusion, it was established that ICT had a significant effect on the record-keeping and the grading system of students in secondary schools and was less significant in setting and marking of examinations.</p>
                <p>The study established that ICT in school had not yet played an important role in enhancing communication flow between administrators and parents. Many parents could not respond in time when internet communications were used by administrators. This was due to the reason that many parents lacked adequate skill to use internet communication and some others did not have access to computers. Most of the parents preferred mobile phone communication to the internet. However, there was a significant role that the use of ICT had brought in as far as making decision easy within schools. It had also played a part in improving collaboration between students, teachers, and administrators in schools. It was realized that the use of ICT improved the monitoring level of students' attendance in classes due to easy tracking of attendance and dodging. So students' progress could easily be tracked. ICT facilities like SMS, emails, chat rooms, discussion boards, and website announcements had a contribution to influencing teachers and administrators to participate in school activities. Transparency and accountability in schools' activities and programs were increased due to the use of ICT facilities.</p>
