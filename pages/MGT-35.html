            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the analysis in chapter four above, the following findings were concluded:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Role conflicts result in low productivity, tension, and psychological withdrawal from the teamwork. Role conflict and job stress have significant effects on workers' productivity and increased absenteeism and turnover. Emotional quotient can affect the relationship between role conflict and accountant productivity, and role conflict has a significant effect on workers' productivity.</li>
                    <li>Inter-group conflict affects workers' productivity in an organization. Intra-group conflict affects workers' productivity in an organization. Moderate levels of conflict improve productivity since they stimulate thinking and creativity in decision making towards goal achievement. Group conflict can be caused by task interdependencies, jurisdictional ambiguities, and communication problems.</li>
                    <li>Proper conflict management strategies should be implemented to enhance workers' productivity. Conflict has a negative impact on worker productivity. Educating the workforce on the best way to channel their grievances improves workers' productivity, and poor conflict resolution approaches have adverse effects on workers' productivity.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>To enhance the productivity of the organization, it is imperative to improve harmony, develop favorable relationships, and alleviate organizational conflict among the workers. This study has undertaken to examine the antecedents of organizational conflict and the circumstances under which organizational conflict affects workers' productivity. The research has investigated the relationships between workers' productivity and conflict attributes that significantly impact workers' productivity in an organization. The study has been conducted to investigate role conflict, relationship conflict, and group conflict on workers' productivity.</p>
