            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Major findings of the study are summarized as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It was discovered that corruption in Barkin Ladi local government is very high.</li>
                    <li>The findings revealed that Barkin Ladi local government has provided development to the citizens.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that the study provides an understanding of the pro-activeness and effectiveness of local government in addressing the critical problems of corruption in the public service, including the local government councils in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>The findings revealed that to a large extent, corruption has affected the development of the area.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that the findings of the study expose the negative effect of rural development and the extent to which corrupt practices have affected the performance of most local government councils in Nigeria.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Reflective of the manifestations of local government and rural development in the political, social, administrative, and economic life of the Nigeria state is the decaying infrastructure, inadequate medical services, falling standard of education, neglect of the basic/fundamental needs of the people, loss of resources (human and material). Added to the above is the routine roadblock by conventional and mobile police. It could also be seen in the way and manner elections are conducted vis-Ã -vis electoral malpractices either by politicians, political parties, and electoral officials. Administrative bottlenecks which make it expedient for corrupt acts to strive. Inflation of contract sums so that certain groups of individuals or people could be compensated for their assistance before the contract was awarded. Ethnic clandestine and similar biological and primordial relationships are favored.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that bad governance is the bane of national development. In order to break this cycle, accountability and transparency have to be guaranteed, and the people have to be involved in issues that affect their lives and immediate environment. Transparency and accountability in governance will help increase the sense of national community.</p>
