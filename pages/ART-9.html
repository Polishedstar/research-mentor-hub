            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings from this study revealed the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A significant number of secondary school students in Lagos metropolis are aware of social media and have access to various social networking sites.</li>
                    <li>Secondary school students in Lagos metropolis frequently engage in various online social networking activities.</li>
                    <li>Considerable amounts of time are spent on social networking sites compared to academic activities by secondary school students in Lagos metropolis.</li>
                    <li>Due to the substantial time spent on social networking activities, the academic performance of students experiences setbacks, which can lead to poor grades. Consequently, students struggle to find a balance between social media and academic activities.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This study has demonstrated that secondary school students in Lagos metropolis are not only aware of social networking sites but also have easy access to them. The findings suggest that these students are significantly influenced by social networks, often in a negative way. Their attention tends to be focused on chatting and music, while their academic activities are neglected and left to suffer.</p>
