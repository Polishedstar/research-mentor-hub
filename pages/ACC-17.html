            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
              <p>From the analysis in Chapter four (4) of this project work, all the data analyzed clearly show that the personal income tax laws and their enforcement exist in the Board of Internal Revenue, Jos. The Board is currently dealing with many cases of enforcing the law. The analysis also highlights some problems faced by the Board of Internal Revenue:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Illiteracy/ignorance of taxpayers about their obligation to pay taxes, which necessitates the enforcement of laws guiding them to submit to tax administrators for tax assessment.</li>
                  <li>Tax administrators/collectors easily succumbing to bribes, which prompts the enforcement of personal income tax laws to reduce or eliminate bribery practices and improve taxation.</li>
                  <li>Poor utilization of funds by the government, which leads taxpayers to believe that their taxes go into individual pockets, resulting in the enforcement of tax laws to correct this misperception and enhance the standard of taxation among taxpayers.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The analysis also reveals the level of cooperation that taxpayers provide to tax administrators. They readily submit accounts for tax assessment purposes, willingly make payments even without receiving the tax assessment forms, and agree with the assessments conducted by the administrators.</p>
