            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Modern stage lighting equipment offers significantly more capabilities compared to traditional lights in the theatre. Traditional lights are static and provide only one color, while modern stage lighting equipment is not only low in wattage, but it also doesn't generate heat. Moreover, modern lighting equipment can perform a multitude of functions, including producing multiple colors simultaneously from a single source and enabling movement for enhanced focusing and distribution.</p>
            
                <p>However, it's important to note that the procurement of modern stage lighting can be expensive, limiting access to only a few vendors who can afford it. As a result, many lighting practitioners continue to rely on traditional lights. In some cases, a combination of both traditional and modern stage lighting can result in a heightened performance, as demonstrated in the researcher's case study of "Fela: Arrest the Music."</p>
            
                <p>To utilize the special features of modern lights effectively, a deep understanding of computer software is required. These lights need to be programmed, often scene by scene, in order to achieve the desired lighting effects.</p>
