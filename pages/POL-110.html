            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the findings in the course of the research, the study discovered that despite the massive and abundant mineral resources, some of the fundamental factors that account for the high rate of unemployment in Nigeria which has resulted in youth restiveness include the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Neglect of Agricultural Sector</strong>
                        <p>The agricultural sector has been the leading provider of employment in Nigeria, especially in the sixties and the seventies when the sector provided employment for more than 60 percent of the Nigerian population. However, unfortunately, in the wake of oil discovery, the attention on the anchor of the economy was gradually drawn away to the oil sector where employment capacity is very low.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gradual Collapse of Manufacturing Sector</strong>
                        <p>There is no vibrant manufacturing sector which has the capacity to absorb unemployed youths in Nigeria. There are over 800 collapsed industries in Nigeria, and over 37 factories closed in 2009. About half of the remaining operating firms have been classified as "ailing," a situation that poses a great threat to the survival of the manufacturing sector in the country.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Low Economic Growth Rate</strong>
                        <p>The overall situation in the economy in the 1999-2003 and even in this decade has been very hostile to economic growth and development. The high level of corruption, mismanagement of public funds, harsh economic policies, and the insecurity of the Nigerian environment coupled with long-term despotic rule of the military, among other factors, have affected economic growth for a long time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wrong Impression about Technical and Vocational Studies</strong>
                        <p>The wrong impression of students about the place of technical and vocational education also accounts for the deteriorating state of unemployment in Nigeria. There is also an enduring societal bias attitude against technical and vocational education. A large number of job seekers lack practical skills that could enhance self-employment.</p>
                    </li>
