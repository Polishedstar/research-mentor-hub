                    <li>
                        Findings from the research work revealed that sales promotion is an effective tool for motivating customers' patronage and helps the organization to achieve sustainable growth. This is based on the fact that once customers are motivated, they patronize the organization's product more and make positive comments on the product, which attracts new customers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The findings also revealed that during sales promotion, customers are lured into buying above their usual quantity, which helps the organization increase its sales, thereby covering the overhead cost of sales promotion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is also important to note that from the findings, it is revealed that during sales promotion, organizations encounter problems in one way or the other. This entails that there are some hurdles such as lack of funds, lack of trained personnel, among others, which hinder the success of the organization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is also worth mentioning here that those organizations that refuse to use sales promotion do so at the detriment of losing their customers because customers are motivated when they feel the impact of their money.
