        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study has examined the impact of anthropogenetic factors in urban flooding with specific focus on the city of Ibadan using two local governments (Ibadan south-west and Ibadan north-west) within this district as a sample. It traced the evolution of flood in the city and the different factors that influence flood incidents with a major focus on the anthropogenetic factors and with a view to evaluate its impact on the city of Ibadan and the people living there.</p>
            
                <p>The result of the research shows that flooding in Ibadan is caused by anthropogenetic factors which are overwhelmed by climatic factors (humans contribute largely to urban flooding with their day-to-day activities). The study also shows that drainages in the city of Ibadan are not free from blockages, some of which are blocked with household waste, while some are weak.</p>
            
                <p>The study also explores the reasons why people are vulnerable to this disaster. Although this vulnerability is caused by different factors such as accommodation pressure in the city, low house rent in vulnerable areas, vulnerable areas being near to their place of work, and some being born in vulnerable areas. However, all of these are what makes people in the city of Ibadan live in areas that are vulnerable to flooding.</p>
            
                <p>Based on the findings in this thesis, it is concluded that changing rainfall interfaced with anthropogenic factors such as non-expansion of the drainage network, obstruction of the drainage system, and poor land use control are responsible for the increasing incidence of flooding in Ibadan City. However, the combined effects of climate and anthropogenic factors on flooding may have been further aggravated due to low water infiltration because of soil type and concretization of the city’s surfaces. This research work has also revealed that flooding has impacted negatively on people in the selected flood areas, mainly resulting in the disruption of socioeconomic activities, loss of life, and loss of properties.</p>
            
                <p>It is, therefore, recommended that the government should carry out rapid drainage redesigning and expansion in Ibadan City to meet the prevailing challenges of anthropogenetic factors and its resultant increase in rainstorms. In addition, proper land use control should be enforced to prevent people from building on flood-prone areas.</p>
            
                <p>While these general principles are fine in theory, the researcher took care to survey what is happening in the city of Ibadan, as in other countries; relatively little has been undertaken by local government. Local authorities had not done any work on the drainage system and were not doing any cleaning and maintenance. The city’s big drainages were "blocked with household waste, while developers, possibly factory owners, have built structures and walls over some of the drains. Despite high-sounding and noble ideals in the national disaster management strategy, the researcher found that the translation of the disaster management policy into practice is far from being realized. Local council leaders are failing to enforce regulations that govern building houses and sanitation. No district disaster management committee exists in Ibadan district, and floods are not seen as a key issue afflicting slum dwellers.</p>
