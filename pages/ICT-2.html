            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study is based on socio-technological analysis of cybercrime and cyber-security in Nigeria. In carrying out the study, the researcher made use of structured interview questions for law enforcement agencies and governmental cyber-security agencies in order to determine the approaches adopted to combat cybercrime and ensuring cybersecurity in Nigeria. Interactive questions for scammers in understanding the mode, methods, and techniques used for engaging cybercrime activities and reviewed scammer and scam baiter correspondences in order to establish Nigerian-based topology of cybercrime. The study also made use of structural functionalism, Marxist theory, Routine Activity Theory, and Technology-Enabled Crime Theory in examining and explaining cybercrime and cyber-security threat in Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>The findings from this study show that the available enabling criminal laws used by law enforcement agencies, which are the Advance Fee Fraud Act of 2006, the Money Laundering Act of 2004 section 12(1)(c) – (d), the Economic and Financial Crime Commission Act of 2005, and the Evidence Act of 1948, are not sufficient enough to address the menace of cybercrime directly. As such, an appropriate cyber-law is required urgently to tackle the activities of cybercrime and ensure cyber-security.</p>
            
                <p>The findings also show that the government cyber-security agency ensures cyber-security through capacity building, workshops on cybercrime, public enlightenment programs, interactive sessions with the Bankers’ Committee and Law Enforcement Agencies, sponsored the cybercrime bill, working with the Law Reform Commission in updating the evidence act, and partnering with the private sector in setting network security rules. However, these are not sufficient enough, as proactive measures are required to ensure cyber safety on the Internet.</p>
            
                <p>The findings also reveal the Nigerian-based typology of cybercrime and the clues in identifying fraudulent e-mail messages or fraudulent links within them. It also indicates that Nigerian scammers pose more as governmental organizations when perpetrating their activities in order to establish the authenticity of their transactions.</p>
