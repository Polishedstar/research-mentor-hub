            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
              <p>This research work shows the Internal Control as an Effective Tool for Management Control in Industrial Training Fund. The analyses were based on findings in textbooks and the responses to the questions in the questionnaires distributed to the staff of Industrial Training Fund.</p>
              <p>From the project work, we are able to look into what internal control is, elements of the internal control system, requisites, and prerequisites of the internal control system, and organizational effectiveness. The internal control system in Industrial Training Fund was also discussed.</p>
              <p>In the analysis, the researcher was able to deduce that for effective control to exist, a sound internal control system has to be in place. In the course of the research, 25 questionnaires were distributed to the staff of Industrial Training Fund, but only 20 were returned. Simple average was used to analyze the collected data. Besides the questionnaires, the researcher also had a face-to-face discussion (interview) with the respondents.</p>
              <p>From the analysis using question 15 in which 75% responded positively while 25% responded negatively to the question. “Have the internal control functions been meeting its responsibility of ensuring adherence to laid down rules safeguarding losses and preventing the incidence of mismanagement of public funds and resources?” It reveals that the internal control system has a positive effect on the organization's effectiveness in areas of ensuring adherence to laid down rules and safeguarding assets. However, the internal control system, although having effects on the organization's effectiveness and efficiency, is not the only measure of the organization's effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
