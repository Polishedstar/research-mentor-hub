                <p>From the outset of this research work, which focuses on "developing a vehicle security gate-check authentication security system," the planned approach to achieving the set goal was realized by the end of Chapter Four. This project also assesses the biometric methods or techniques used and highlights a few limitations in their implementation, particularly concerning security access exceptions and user safety. A system has been designed and simulated for a comprehensive and successful implementation, with the recommendation for further maintenance, evolution, or system enhancement.</p>
                <p>There is a growing realization that security issues pose a threat not only to personal information but also to the human race, surpassing the measures developed to address these security concerns. Vehicle security systems provide a solution for controlling access and unauthorized exit from organizations. The cost of securing and implementing a vehicle gate-check security system has proven to be more cost-effective than hiring human experts and mitigating risk vulnerabilities.</p>
            
                <p>As we navigate the digital age of computing machinery and information and communication technology, we envision a swift means of providing a security platform that eliminates the need for carrying ID cards or gate-passes to gain access through any security system, ensuring a more comfortable and secure society.</p>
