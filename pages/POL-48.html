            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study assessed the extent to which N-Power, as a policy, is being used as a strategy to reduce poverty in the State and the country at large. The study specifically ascertained the adequacy of community participation in the Community Services Scheme, evaluated the extent of the community's participation in Vocational Skills Training Scheme, and its effects on their poverty level. It also examined the extent of the youth's involvement in N-Agro, N-Health, N-Teach, etc., by empowering them, leading to their poverty reduction in the State.</p>
                <p>From the data presented and analyzed, the study concludes that N-Power is an effective policy/programme for empowering people and reducing poverty. This conclusion is justified by the fact that the sampled respondents expressed that the program has significantly helped in alleviating poverty and empowering people. Beneficiaries were passionate, committed, and eager to continue with the program implementation in the State. According to the respondents, the program has improved their standard of living, enabling them to pay their children's school fees, buy food, and increase their earnings.</p>
