            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Recruitment technique and its effect on the achievement of organization goals in Public Service was described as a means for promoting efficient organizational performances in spite of growing challenges. Apart from promoting adequate organization, its resource management depends on training to factor efficient leadership in the organization. However, it is not all organizations that acknowledge the relevance of recruitment techniques. Management staff is left to grapple between professional application of knowledge and experience in directing organizational resources. This usually results in increased organizational risk, project mismanagement, leadership inefficiency, and poor supervision, among other issues. This study thus examined the effects of management development on the implementation of recruitment techniques in Jos North L.G.C.</p>
