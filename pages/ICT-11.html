            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The objective of this study is to identify whether Management Information System brings any impact to a business organization. After critical observation of the impact of MIS in a business organization, a case study of Union Bank, it was discovered that the use of Management Information System in an organization has improved the performance of Union Bank, and other business organizations. However, it does not specify the actual performance measure.</p>
                <p>From the analysis, we have reached the conclusion that Management Information System is very helpful to enhance the performance of the organization in the sense of profitability, innovation, and growth. The MIS satisfies diverse needs through a variety of systems, such as the query system, analysis system, modeling system, and decision support system. The MIS helps in strategic planning, management control, operational control, and transaction processing.</p>
                <p>The MIS helps the clerical personnel in transaction processing and answers the queries on the data pertaining to the transaction, the status of a particular record, and reference on a variety of documents. The MIS helps the top-level management in goal setting, strategic planning, and evolving the business plans and their implementation. The MIS plays the role of information generation, communication, problem identification, and helps in the process of decision-making.</p>
