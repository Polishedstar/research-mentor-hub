            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was undertaken to examine the need for training and re-training of secretarial professionals with modern information and communication technologies.</p>
            
                <p>The study revealed the following findings among others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The modern information and communication technologies required for the training of secretaries include computers, internet-ready ICT center, telecommunications software and hardware devices, multimedia projectors, electronic boards (smart boards), and digital cameras. Others are scanners, bulletin board systems, fax machines, electronic typewriters, and word processors.</li>
                    <li>Modern ICT devices impact secretarial training through the provision of opportunities for the use of multiple technologies, creation of greater enthusiasm for skill acquisition amongst secretaries, providing the secretary with new sources of information and knowledge, and exposing the secretary to vocational and workforce skills.</li>
                    <li>The training and re-training of secretaries or secretarial professionals with modern information and communication technologies are challenged by factors such as inadequate funding, inadequate skills or capacity in the use of modern ICTs, high cost of purchase, installation, and maintenance of ICT facilities, inadequate functional ICT facilities for training secretaries, erratic supply of public electricity, poor ICT infrastructure base, and poor maintenance culture in schools.</li>
                    <li>Solutions to the challenges affecting the use of modern information and communication technologies for the training of secretaries include improving funding, technical training and retraining programs for trainers, subsidizing the cost of ICT facilities, providing functional ICT facilities, providing alternative sources of electricity supply, and imbuing a positive maintenance culture.</li>
