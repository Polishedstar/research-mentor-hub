            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research study on the effects of child abuse on the academic performance of pupils in primary schools in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, Nigeria, revealed among others the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Effective teaching focuses on the importance of providing learning and growth opportunities for students that are designed to engage them (Friesen, 2009). The result of this shift is a deeper commitment by students to explore and internalize their ideas and establish meaningful connections to their work. Involving students in curriculum decision making is a significant step toward ensuring that enduring authentic understanding takes place (Friesen, 2009).</li>
                    <li>Poverty is the cause of child abuse: The study shows that high poverty levels have forced many children into the labor market, which has a consequential effect on the academic performance of students. 15 million Nigerian children under the age of 14 are working to support their families and pay their school fees (UNICEF Nigeria, 2019). The work they do is often in the informal labor market, hawking goods on the street or highways or harvesting crops for approximately 20 hours each week (Okpukpara & Odukwe, 2006) cited in Nicola et al (2012). It is unacceptable that the majority of these children revealed that working long hours causes them to miss at least one day of school each week, which may lead to low academic performance. The net attendance ratio for primary school in Nigeria is quite low at 61.1% (NPC, 2009), and in rural areas, it is 57%. The South East of the nation has the best primary school enrollment ratio at 82.8%, while the North-West has only 43.7% as cited in Nicola et al (2002).</li>
                    <li>The study explains that a child may come to school in soiled clothing or clothing that is significantly too small or large for them, often in need of repair. A child may demonstrate poor hygiene, smell of urine or feces, and come to school with little or no food. The study also revealed challenges in the neurological development of the child with a high degree of poor academic achievement in school and other negative attitudes like aggression and unpredicted social exclusion, psychological and physiological consequences. A child can be psychologically and socially balanced if they are loved, adored, cared for, and given the opportunity to play and leisure, explore the world, interact fully with peers, and bond with family.</li>
                    <li>The relationship between the child, parents, and teachers is based on fear and psychological distress may be associated with the findings. It indicates that there are positive solutions to the problems of child abuse in Nigeria.</li>
                </ul>
