            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study focused on the comparative analysis of the readership of Print and Online Newspapers in Nigeria, with a concentration on the Jos-Plateau region. The primary objective was to examine the readership patronage of Print Newspapers in comparison to the challenges posed by the emergence of Online Newspapers due to technological advancements.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter One provided a background of the readership comparison between Print Newspapers and Online Newspapers, highlighting the significant challenges faced by Print Newspapers due to the introduction of Online Newspapers. The study aimed to analyze the readership levels between the two mediums, with the knowledge gained being valuable to newspaper publishers, readers, scholars, and communication industry students.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter two reviewed relevant literature from scholars who have made comments and observations on the readership question concerning Print and Online newspapers. The primary theory employed in this study is the Uses and Gratification Theory.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter three discussed the methodology, with the study using a Survey Method and questionnaires as the instrument for a sample size of two hundred (200) respondents. The respondents included Civil Servants (40), Media Professionals (40), Mass Communication Lecturers (40), Mass Communication Students (40), and Public Relations Practitioners (40). Questionnaires were administered to these groups in the University of Jos, NTA TV College, Jos, Plateau State Polytechnic, Barkin-Ladi, Jos Campus, and Civil Servants in Jos Metropolis. Out of the 200 questionnaires, only 159 were returned.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter four presented the findings, revealing that most respondents read Online Newspapers more frequently (82%) but also read Print Newspapers because they are more accessible and available. The findings further indicated that Nigerians prefer Print Newspapers over Online Newspapers and that the primary implication of the threat posed by Online Newspapers to Print Newspapers is the depletion of their readership population. In essence, Online Newspapers are indeed a significant threat to Print Newspapers.</p>
            
                <p>In conclusion, the findings of the study also showed that the majority of respondents do not believe that Print Newspapers would go into extinction due to low readership or revenue profiles.</p>
