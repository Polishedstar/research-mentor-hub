            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Firstly, the study revealed that respondents could reach an agreement on trade union use of a collective bargaining agreement to negotiate for better pay and workplace protection. However, respondents agreed that working conditions in the organization are poor, trade unions have a significant influence on the working conditions of the employees, and the occupational health and safety program has an impact on organizational performance. In addition, respondents also agreed that trade unions can positively or negatively affect the organization's productivity, a reduction in accidents and injuries influences performance, employees are aware of occupational health and safety concerns, the organization has adequate occupational health and safety procedures, inadequate compensation has a negative impact on organizational performance, and training influences organizational performance.</p>
                <p>It was also revealed that respondents agreed that trade unions represent workers at disciplinary and grievance hearings, conflict management had a significant effect on organizational performance, mediation is used to solve conflicts arising from personal differences, and trade union negotiation influences organizational performance. However, respondents could not reach an agreement on unfair termination of employment contracts and underpayment of wages influencing labor disputes, the organization having conflict management strategies in place, the organization offering seminars and workshops on conflict management, third-party intervention having a positive influence on organizational performance, and using arbitration as a third-party intervention to improve performance.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, this study set out to determine the effect that trade unions have on a firm's productivity using Plateau State Polytechnic BarkinLadi as a case study. The reason being that it has always been said by trade unionists that their existence is good for the organization's workers in particular and the whole firm in general. Indeed, the unions have orchestrated a number of activities to benefit their members and ensure their well-being at the places of work. This, however, does not mean that every company has a trade union. Many employers, particularly small and medium-size companies, resist trade unions, and in most cases, they attempt to suppress their formation.</p>
                <p>Trade unions should add additional value to their members in the work they perform. Besides bringing security to life and improving working conditions, the union should strive to bring new values to its members. The union should concentrate on membership education and training for its members, providing training in labor rights and collective bargaining.</p>
                <p>In a nutshell, trade unions should focus much more on the needs and desires of their members. The union should be more member-oriented, as members are paying membership fees and should receive good-quality services in return. Trade unions should be clear about their mission and vision, aligning them individually and cooperatively with the three social partners. Additionally, trade unions can add value for employers by cooperating with them for the betterment of the company and the future of the members. Participative decision-making within trade unions and management will lead to a stable atmosphere for performance, within which good worker performance can be achieved.</p>
