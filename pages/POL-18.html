            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Local government administration is a third tier of government created by law and has substantial control over its affairs, staff, and finances. Local government administration is different from local administration (native authority). Local governments are managed by elected officials and have a source of finance, with functions stipulated in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In contrast, local government or native authority officials are not elected but appointed and are accountable to the person that appoints them. They do not have any source of revenue.</p>
                <p>Local government was created with the purpose of bringing government closer to the local people and fostering development in rural areas, including economic, social, and political development. It is the responsibility of local government to bring development to rural areas, such as boreholes, good markets, parks, Primary Health Care (PHC), primary education, agriculture, transparency, and accountability, among others.</p>
                <p>The research is set to examine the intricate relationship between local government and rural development in Jos South Local Government Council of Plateau State. However, our findings revealed that there is poor development in Jos South Local Government of Plateau State due to a number of reasons, including corruption by local government officials, inadequate skilled manpower and trained personnel, mal-administration, lack of autonomy for local government, and interference in local government affairs by both Federal and State governments, among others.</p>
                <p>Local government administration can meet its expectations when given full autonomy, free from interference from other levels of government. Local government activities should be monitored regularly, and those found guilty of corruption should be severely punished to set examples for others. Workshops should be organized for local government officials at least every year, and their salaries should be paid regularly to reduce corruption.</p>
