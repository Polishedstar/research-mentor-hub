                <p>Corruption thrives because the agents have technically crippled the power of accountability. Although several measures have been developed to combat corruption, these measures ignore the vital element of the accountability relationship (man) and concentrate on modifying the systems of accountability. The auditing function of accounting, designed to give the principal control over the operation of the agents, is under the control of the agents. Its main object is not fraud detection; it is the agent that appoints the auditor who reports to the agent and is paid by the agent. In most instances where corrupt practices are uncovered, the audit reports are always clean; therefore, the rules and procedures must be changed in favor of the principal. This will empower the principal to demand and ensure accountability and guarantee sustainable development.</p>
                <p>Combating corruption is not without conditions; it requires:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Measures to address corruption must not fail to adequately consider and integrate the underlying drivers or face the unlikelihood of generating profound and sustainable results.</li>
                    <li>Such an approach must not apply common policies and tools (that is, one-size-fits-all approaches) to countries in which acts of corruption and the quality of governance vary widely. Doing so increases the likelihood of failure.</li>
                    <li>There should be strong and focused local principles and ownership if the suggested strategies are to be successful and sustainable.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This research has examined the causes, solutions, and suggestions for reducing the level of corruption in Nigeria. This research has also established and pointed out cases that have had a disorganized effect on our country, Nigeria.</p>
                <p>This research has also shown how corruption in the political realm undermines democracy and good governance. Politicians and public officials should be made accountable for their actions, be transparent, and act openly.</p>
                <p>This research also discusses the role of legislative bodies responsible for addressing corrupt practices in Nigeria (EFCC and ICPC) against fraudulent practices such as bribery, money laundering, etc.</p>
                <p>The research also provides certain approaches on how to tackle corruption in Nigeria and also encourages that punishments should be stringent to prevent further intending corrupt practices by public officers.</p>
                <p>The research has also discovered corruption as a threat to the rule of law. Corruption jeopardizes the proper functioning of public institutions, disrupts the legislative process, and if there is no rule of law without access to justice before independent and impartial courts, it sets an impossible way for prosecuting and eradicating corrupt practices in Nigeria.</p>
