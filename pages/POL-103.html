            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This is aimed at analyzing the impact of legislature and sustenance of democracy in Nigeria. Legislature is an essential organ of Government, which can be used in achieving the tenets of democracy. Therefore, for our democracy to thrive, and for development to take place, the legislature has a role to play. To achieve this, (40) questionnaires were administered randomly to the legislators and staff of Plateau State House of Assembly. The research shows that the legislature ensures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protection of fundamental human rights</li>
                    <li>Monitoring of budgets</li>
                    <li>Legislation of good governance</li>
                    <li>Equal distribution of resources</li>
                    <li>Check and control of the executive excesses</li>
                    <li>Control of the administrative power of the executive organs and their agencies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on the findings of this research work, the researcher can safely conclude that the legislature is a central pillar of democracy in the country. The failure and success of any government are attributed to legislative organs of Government. The ultimate aim of any legislative body in sustaining democracy is to ensure good governance, the rule of law, and the supremacy of the constitution. The legislative arm of Government in Nigeria, particularly in Plateau State, has done averagely well, but more effort should be made to ensure that their responsibilities are not relegated to the background.</p>
