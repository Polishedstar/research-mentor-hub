            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The following section presents a summary of the study that sought to determine the Assessment of the Impact of unemployment on crime and criminality in Jos South LGA.</p>
            
                <p>The first objective of this study was to interrogate the Assessment of the Impact of unemployment on urban crime. The conclusion for the first objective was that high rates of unemployment led to high crime and criminality. Long-term unemployment also caused poverty that forced many urban youths to commit criminal activities such as robbery, rape, and prostitution as an alternative way of acquiring income.</p>
            
                <p>The second objective of this study was to analyze the impact of unemployment on crime and criminality. The conclusion for the second objective was that unemployment had a direct impact in increasing crime and criminality among urban youth. A majority of unemployed youth end up in the streets and urban slums where they are easily influenced to indulge in petty criminal activities like prostitution and drug abuse. Many unemployed youths are easily lured to terror gangs and political violence.</p>
            
                <p>The third objective of this study was to investigate the reasons why urban youths are attracted to criminality. The conclusion for the third objective was that urban youth are attracted to crime due to unemployment, perceived political disenfranchisement, high rewards from crime, high rates of poverty, widespread social discrimination, effects of drug and substance abuse, inadequate education, and unmet life expectations.</p>
            
                <p>The fourth objective of this study was to identify policy changes required to achieve crime reduction and an enhanced quality of life for urban youths. The conclusion for the fourth objective was that crime reduction and an enhanced quality of life for urban youths could be achieved through specific policy changes. These policy changes include pursuing job creation and youth empowerment initiatives, welfare benefits, development of an explicit government policy on crime reduction, creation of new government initiatives like Youth Fund for youth economic empowerment, development of fair recruitment regimes, passing laws that compel senior citizens to take early retirement, and extending compulsory education and vocational training to all urban youth.</p>
