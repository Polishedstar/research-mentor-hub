            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Leadership is a social influence process in which the leader seeks the voluntary participation of subordinates in an effort to reach organization goals, a process whereby one person exerts social influence over other members of the group, a process of influencing the activities of an individual or a group of individuals in an effort towards goal achievement in given situations. Leadership is a relational concept involving influencing agent and the person being influenced. Effective leadership is the extent to which a leader continually and progressively leads and directs his/her followers to the agreed destination which is defined by the whole group.</p>
            
                <p>Leadership style is the pattern of behaviors engaged in by the leader when dealing with employees. There are three leadership styles which are autocratic, democratic, and laissez-faire. Autocratic leadership style involves the leader making all the decisions, wielding absolute power, assigning tasks to members of the group, and maintaining a master-servant relationship with members of the group. On the other hand, democratic leadership style involves the use of a consultative approach, encourages group participation in decision making, and maintains a master-master relationship with group members. The laissez-faire leadership style involves a non-interference policy, allows complete freedom to all employees, and has no particular way of attaining goals. However, there is no one best style of leadership. The effectiveness of a particular style is dependent on the organizational situation.</p>
            
                <p>Leadership is a process by which a person influences others to accomplish an objective and directs the organization in a way that makes it more cohesive and coherent. Leaders carry out this process by applying their leadership attributes, such as beliefs, values, ethics, character, knowledge, and skills. A leader must have the desire and willpower. A leader becomes an effective leader when he/she inspires the employees into higher levels of teamwork; there are certain things the organization must be, know, and do.</p>
            
                <p>Leadership differs in that it makes the followers want to achieve high goals, rather than simply bossing people around. Personality traits lead people naturally into leadership roles. A crisis or important event may cause a person to rise to the occasion, which brings out extraordinary leadership qualities in an ordinary person. This is the Great Events Theory. People can choose to become leaders. People learn leadership skills. It is the most widely accepted theory today and the premise on which this guide is based. Authoritarian (autocratic) this leader is used when the leader tells her employees what she wants to be done and how she wants it done, without getting the advice of her team.</p>
            
                <p>Some people think that this style includes yelling using demeaning language, and leading by threats and abuse of power. This is not the authoritarian style. It is an abusive, unprofessional style of leadership. Participative (Democratic) this style involves the leader including one or more employees in the decision-making process to determine what to do and how to do it. However, the leader maintains the final decision-making authority.</p>
            
                <p>This is normally used when you have some of the information, and your employees have some of the information. This allows them to become part of the team and allows you to make a better decision. Delegate (free-reign) the leader allows the employees to make the decision. However, the leader is still responsible for the decisions that are made. This is used when employees are able to analyze the situation and determine what needs to be done and how to do it. You cannot do everything! You must set priorities and delegate certain tasks.</p>
            
                <p>Leadership is the exercise of authority and the making of decisions. Leadership is the initiation of acts that result in a consistent pattern of group interaction directed toward the solution of mutual problems. Interpersonal influence exercised in a situation and directed through the communication process, toward the attainment of a specified goal or goals.</p>
            
                <p>Leadership then appears to be the capability and actual processes or actions that are attributed to leaders. Leadership style thus refers to the consistency of goals or needs over different situations. The leadership style is the consistent patterns of behavior which you exhibit, as perceived by others when you are attempting to influence the activities of people. By the term style, we generally mean a relatively enduring set of behaviors which are characteristic of the individual regardless of the situation. As is apparent, these leadership style definitions have in common a notion of a certain level of continuity in the leadership behaviors of particular leaders.</p>
