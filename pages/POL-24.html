            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>As the research draws to a conclusive end, the research summarizes the following for the study:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It was observed that one of the major problems that affect human capital development and management in Plateau State Civil Service Commission particularly and Nigeria in general is the issue of planning deficiency.</li>
                    <li>It also indicates that the Nigerian Civil Service is negatively affected with colonial mentality which led to the exploitation of human and material resources.</li>
                    <li>Further findings show that poor leadership has a lot of implications on the process of executing policies that relate to manpower planning, which leads to human capital development and management.</li>
                    <li>Training and development of manpower were also found out to be a vital tool for the growth, development, transformation, and the nation at large.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the negative influence of corruption and mismanagement of funds further prevents the growth and development in the state civil service commission and the nation at large.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Human capital development and management are regarded as a vital instrument and also considered to be an indispensable requirement that triggers transformation and development of the nation's socio-economic and political sector.</p>
                <p>Human resources do not mean that they are people who are restricted to working in organizations for improved productivity but rather the mention of human capital development and management signifies the generality of people who have acquired or need to acquire certain skills, innovations, initiatives, and creativity that will lead to an improvement in the living standard of such individuals who reside in a nation or country.</p>
                <p>The manpower of every country is a determinant factor in how the success or failure of the country. In other words, human capital development and management constitute a tool of competent, focused, trained, and developed individuals for transforming government policies, programs, and projects into reality. The mention of human capital or manpower indicates the totality of individuals with a high level of capability for national transformation and individual improvement.</p>
                <p>The researcher suggests the following recommendations as a solution to the problems identified:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The management of Plateau State Civil Service is encouraged to embark on manpower planning and developing its human resources in order to transform the organization for a better future.</li>
                    <li>The colonial mentality of godfatherism and favoritism should be holistically dealt with to ensure that such cases are discredited, and workers will be employed based on merits.</li>
                    <li>The leadership of the country and the management of Plateau State Civil Service Commission should ensure that there is an opportunity for effective execution of policies, programs, and projects that have a significant impact on human capital development of manpower should be the primary objective and the guiding principles for achieving a viable workplace for the commission and the nation at large.</li>
                    <li>There should be accountability, transparency, and profitability in the process of applying funds set aside for the training and development of manpower, which has been recommended as an instrument that leads to efficiency and effectiveness of human development in nation building.</li>
                </ol>
