            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>During the course of this research work, the following findings evolved:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That the banking sectors in Jos develop effective Public Relations to influence attitudes of customers towards the banking services.</li>
                    <li>That the image of the banks is promoted by its Public Relations Strategy.</li>
                    <li>That Public Relations activities contribute to the success of the banking sectors in Jos.</li>
                    <li>That the friendly relationship between the customers and the banks is as a result of Public Relations activities in place in the banks, and it is a good and healthy relationship that is supposed to be exhibited by banks in Jos.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Banks are operating in a dynamic business environment, and there is a need for various firms to be up to date in developing an effective strategy to keep up with the pace of growth in the industry. This can only be achieved by defining the target market, developing an effective marketing mix, advertising, promotion, planning execution in a continuous process.</p>
                <p>Conclusively, it will be safe to conclude that the banking sectors in Jos, especially some selected banks, must attach immense importance to Public Relations marketing strategy to gain and sustain competitive advantage, goodwill, so as to increase its market share and profit.</p>
