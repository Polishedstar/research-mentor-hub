            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the research conducted in the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, the following summary is drawn:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is the need for a manpower planning unit in the organization, and there should also be an improvement in the planning strategy of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>The findings reveal that planning brings about effectiveness and efficiency in organizational operations and awareness in the organization.</li>
                    <li>Training, recruitment, and planning are important aspects of increasing efficiency in the organization, and priority should be accorded to these variables.</li>
                    <li>The research study also reveals that the issue of personnel training within the initiative of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria has continued to elude the people at the grassroots, as the majority of them attest to the fact that they have never been sent for training in the organization. This implies that the government needs to improve in this area.</li>
                    <li>Deductions from the research have shown that the best way an organization can implement its objectives is through a multi-dimensional approach, which ranges from training and retraining of personnel, management contracts, through the existing government departments, and through discipline.</li>
                    <li>Regarding the question of the indispensability and inevitability of the need for training in every organization, whether big or small, the majority of the respondents endorsed the need for training in the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Irregular manpower planning has also been identified as another pointer to the achievement of efficiency in the local government. The belief is based on the premise that irregular training is ideal for working with the status quo. It, therefore, means that planning should be done based on the current need.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the research work has also shown that the best way in which planning should be carried out is through collective effort. This means everybody should be included in the planning process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It has been established during the course of this research that manpower planning brings about efficiency in the organization. Therefore, the need for planning in every organization cannot be overemphasized, taking into consideration the benefits derivable from planning. Planning should not be done haphazardly but in a strategic manner. Strategic planning, as a managerial tool, helps in providing purpose and direction for the members of an organization. It is also a parameter for measuring the success of an organization in terms of its personnel. Consequently, planning can be viable only if it is properly coordinated through the efforts of a planning group rather than individual.</p>
