            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study aimed to identify the digital technology competencies required by Library and Information Science graduates for effective performance in an organization. The findings of the study are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The digital technology competencies needed by Library and Information Science graduates include knowledge of the basic structure and use of an integrated library system, the ability to use electronic mail (e-mail) and social networking services, proficiency in interactive web applications and whiteboard usage, database applications, personal digital assistants, and various office applications.</li>
                    <li>Digital technology competencies promote innovation and creativity, enhance task coordination, increase work efficiency, enable collaboration through real-time communication, streamline office work, eliminate geographical barriers, optimize operations, facilitate information exchanges, and save time and effort required for work.</li>
                    <li>The acquisition of digital technology competencies faces challenges such as inadequate libraries, lack of skills or capacity, resistance to adopting new technologies, overemphasis on theory, inadequate public power supply, insufficient and unsustainable funding, and overadmission of students.</li>
                    <li>Strategies for improved acquisition of digital technology competencies for Library and Information Science graduates include the provision of adequate computer laboratories, capacity-building programs for teachers, a willingness to adopt new technologies, increased emphasis on practical training, providing alternative sources of electricity supply, active private sector involvement in education funding, and ensuring strict adherence to approved student capacity during admission.</li>
