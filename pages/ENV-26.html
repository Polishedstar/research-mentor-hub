            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study established that Ikorodu is one of the towns in Lagos state with related problems of poor environmental sanitation practices. The study showed that the average age of the residents was approximately 30 years. It also established that 46.8% were single while eighty-seven (87) representing 39.9% of the total residents were married. The residents have lived in the area for an average of 10 years. The survey further showed that 38.5% of the residents were students, 25.7% were traders, while 22.5% were civil servants. The minimum and maximum average monthly incomes in the area were N1,200 and N80,000 respectively. The mean monthly income is approximately N15,000. The study also indicated that 46.8% of the residents had a secondary school qualification, while 17.9% had vocational training.</p>
            
                <p>The study revealed that 52.8% of the residents live in blocks of flats. It was also established that the residents preferred multiple family dwelling units to single-family units due to the price variation and affordability. The study further indicated that 57.3% of the surveyed buildings were owner-occupied.</p>
            
                <p>The study established that the sources of water in the area include well, pipe-borne water, stream, rainfall, borehole, and purchase. The findings showed that the use of well water regularly represents 30.3%. Respondents that use pipe-borne water regularly accounted for 43.6%, while 8.7% use stream water. The proportion that uses water from borehole and purchase sources regularly represents 8.7% and 4.6% respectively. None of the respondents use rainfall water regularly. The study also showed that two significant methods of water purification in the area are boiling and the use of chemical purifiers, representing 47.2% and 22.0% respectively. It was also established that most of the residents who rely on pipe-borne water do not use any form of water purification.</p>
            
                <p>Furthermore, the most significant method of cooking in the area is the use of a kerosene stove. Other methods of cooking include the use of an electric stove, gas cooker, firewood, sawdust, and charcoal.</p>
            
                <p>The study identified the major household sanitation facilities in the area as toilet, kitchen, bathroom, soakway pit, waste water pit, drainage, and septic tank. It was established that only 56% of the buildings have kitchen facilities; 81.7% have toilet facilities, while 78% have bathroom facilities. Buildings with soakaway pit, septic tank, waste water pit, and drainage were 43.1%, 17.4%, 34.4%, and 20.2% respectively. It was also established that 82.2% of the respondents clear their drainage in a week.</p>
            
                <p>The study showed the three major toilet facilities utilized in the area were pit latrine, water closet, and bucket latrine. The use of a water closet gained the highest prominence in the area. The findings also showed the waste storage receptacles used in the area are jerry can, nylon/polythene bag, metal drum, plastic containers, abandoned buckets, covered refuse bin, and paper cartons. It was revealed that the waste storage receptacle mostly used in the area is the covered refuse bins, representing 59.6%, while the use of abandoned buckets and paper cartons for waste storage recorded least significance with an equal proportion of 17.4%.</p>
            
                <p>The household sanitation facilities were either located within or outside the buildings. The study revealed that most of the kitchen, bathroom, and toilet facilities were located within the residence while well, pipe-borne water, and borehole were located outside the buildings. The prominent duration of waste storage before disposal is between 5-7 days. Various methods of waste disposal were used in the area. The Relative Importance Index (RII) used to determine the most widely used waste disposal methods showed solid waste disposal through PSP operators, LAWMA, and barrow/cart pushers gained the highest significance.</p>
            
                <p>The residents respond to inadequacy in provision of sanitation facilities in different ways. The study established that 61% of those who do not have manage the available space, 26% cook in their rooms while 13% cook on the corridor. The study further showed that 47.4% of the residents without toilet facilities do throw their excreta in the drains while 26.3% throw it on vacant lands. Also, 73.7% of the households without bathrooms do have their bath in the open before dawn while the remaining 26.2% use uncompleted buildings. Furthermore, 65.5% of the households without waste water pits discharge their waste water on the street while 34.5% discharge the waste water at the backyard of their buildings.</p>
            
                <p>The residents were fully aware of the need to use the health facilities in the area. Most of the respondents visited the health clinics for the treatment of malaria. Other health cases reported are typhoid, dysentery, cholera, and asthma. The study also established that monitoring of the mandatory sanitation activities by the government, drainage clearance, collection, and disposal of sanitation waste were effective in the area.</p>
