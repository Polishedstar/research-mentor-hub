            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focused on the media (radio) reportage of human rights abuses in Plateau State. Three specific purposes and three research questions were formulated to guide the study. The researcher adopted a descriptive survey design, with the area of the study being Hwoshe Community. The population for the study consisted of 100 students living in Hwoshe Community. The researcher sampled 50 questionnaires from the population. A 1-5 items questionnaire with a 5-point rating scale was used for data collection, and the instrument was face-validated by the project supervisor. Data collected for the study were analyzed using the Likert mean rating to answer the research questions, leading to findings that formed the basis for the conclusion and recommendations.</p>
                <p>The study revealed the following findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The role of media (radio) in promoting human rights abuses includes creating awareness of the need to promote certain values in the cause of human rights, educating people about their rights, exposing violations, and focusing attention on areas in need of human rights protection. It also gives publicity to individuals and organizations working to secure human rights and informs and empowers people to protect their rights. Media (radio) promotes peace, non-violence, disarmament, and the maintenance and promotion of ecological balances.</li>
                    <li>If media (radio) serves as a mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights abuses, this includes spearheading peace and intercommunal understanding, fighting racism, and influencing public opinion by setting a Human Rights-driven agenda in public discourse.</li>
                    <li>The effects of human rights abuses in Plateau State include unemployment, which has led to youth involvement in crimes such as armed robbery, internet scams, and kidnapping, resulting in a high rate of insecurity and ethno-religious violence that causes human rights violations and makes people unpatriotic. This situation has contributed to poverty in the state.</li>
