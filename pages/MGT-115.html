            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study investigated the effect of personal selling on organizational sales volume, and the results indicate that there is a relationship between personal selling and organizational sales volume.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>This implies that personal selling, when effectively carried out, influences and boosts the sales rate of an organization. Personal selling involves a direct relationship between a sales representative and a customer, with the intention of communicating the existence of a product and its basic functions.</li>
                    <li>This result shows that when personal selling is in place, customer intention tends to arouse, causing impulse buying, which, in turn, increases organizational sales volume.</li>
                    <li>The second finding of the study shows that personal selling has an influence on customer demand for a product. Competency of sales representatives, including attributes like boldness, neatness, fluent communication, and deep knowledge about the products, positively impacts consumer demand.</li>
                    <li>Manufacturing organizations should orientate their representatives to enable an upward push in the demand for a product. Personal selling involves one-to-one communication directly with the target audience.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Personal selling is a presentation by the firm's sales force for the purpose of matching sales and building customer relationships. The need for personal selling activities has increased due to stiff competition, market expansion, changes in customer preferences, technological advancements, and the quest to increase customer relationships and the firm's sales volume.</p>
                <p>Through personal selling, sales representatives explain to clients how the services they are selling can satisfy their needs, allowing clients to make inquiries and match their needs with the services. It also helps in introducing new products and services, as well as persuading clients to buy the firm's products, thus increasing sales and expanding the market by identifying new customers and retaining old ones.</p>
