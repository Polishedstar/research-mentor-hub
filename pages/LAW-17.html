            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Chapter one of this work acquainted us with reasons why the researcher embarked on this research work and explained what the researcher intended to do in the subsequent chapters. It was examined in this chapter that trespass has a long historical antecedent which is traceable to the common law of England as early as the 13th Century and it is applicable to Nigeria by virtue of The Interpretation Act of 1989.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter Two examined Trespass to Person. In this chapter, Battery, Assault, and False Imprisonment were identified as the three components that make up Trespass to Person. For an action in Trespass to Person to succeed, the Plaintiff has to prove that the act by the Defendant was without his consent and that such act was direct and physical. One of the findings of the researcher was that Battery does not necessarily have to be a hostile act. Moreover, it was found that to point an unloaded gun at someone is an actionable Assault because there would have been a reasonable fear induced at the Plaintiff, and this is what Assault is about. For there to be an actionable False Imprisonment, the restraint must be complete and unlawful. It was discovered in the course of the research that an action for false imprisonment can be sustained even where the claimant is unaware of such imprisonment.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter three of this work covered the legal framework, where the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended 1999 was reviewed, the Nigerian Criminal Code was studied, and the Nigerian Penal Code was also checked.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter Four dealt with defenses of trespass to person, where the Defense of Person or Property, defense of Consent, defense of lawful arrest, and medical treatment were examined as the defenses available under an action for trespass to Person.</p>
            
                <p>This research work examined the tort of trespass to a person under the Nigerian legal system. The three major forms of trespass to Person include assault, battery, and false imprisonment. It is essential to say at this concluding part that all the forms of trespasses are actionable per se. That is, a plaintiff in an action for trespass does not have to prove damages as part of his case.</p>
