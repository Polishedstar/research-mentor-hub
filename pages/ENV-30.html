            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>

                <p>From the research carried out and findings deduced, the following conclusions are made:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Freight operators in the northern part of Kano metropolis mostly operate from Kano to Lagos.</li>
                    <li>Freight operators in the northern part of Kano metropolis are trained informally. They obtain driver's licenses and comply with traffic rules. They have driving experience of more than 15 years and consume stimulants to boost their morale.</li>
                    <li>Freight operators in the northern Kano metropolis have valid particulars for their vehicles, equip them with safety facilities, and service them mostly on a weekly basis. They have preferences for the types of goods they carry.</li>
                    <li>Roadways within the northern Kano metropolis are in good condition. However, there are no adequate transit facilities, but there are enough loading and delivery points.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>The culture and religion of freight operators influence them in deciding what to carry and what not to carry. They face challenges due to differences in culture, tribe, or religion when they operate outside their domain. In addition, they pay many taxes to different agencies, and there is no good relationship between them and traffic agents. Also, bribery and corruption decrease their income.</p>
