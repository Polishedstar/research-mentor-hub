            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research was conducted to find out the Impact of Non-Financial Incentive on Employee Productivity. While conducting the research work, it was discovered that non-financial incentives have a positive effect to a large extent on employees in the organization. Non-financial incentives are part of the total compensation package that the organization gives to the staff, which increases employee's productivity.</p>
            
                <p>Non-financial incentives play a significant role in any organization. The issue of non-financial incentives is also important to the management because humans work in organizations to meet the hopes, aspirations, and objectives of the organization. Non-financial incentives increase employees' productivity or performance. It also motivates employees or workers to put more effort into their work, attracts new workers, and improves workers' productivity in the organization.</p>
