            <h2>Recommendations of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Sequel to the above discussion, there is the need for overall improvement in the ethical reorientation, moral values, and ethical behaviors among the workers of ITF and indeed the Nigerian Civil Services. The following recommendations are proposed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Leadership positions should be seen as role model positions to afford the younger ones an opportunity to learn and emulate.</li>
                    <li>Meritocracy should be instituted in all spheres of the country as opposed to the present practice of Godfatherism and nepotism.</li>
                    <li>Students should be given an opportunity to operate modern tools and equipment.</li>
                    <li>Adequate security should be in place in the organization to protect the lives and properties of the people.</li>
                    <li>There should be adequate incentives for both staff and their students during work experience.</li>
                    <li>Equitable equipment should be purchased by the organization to enhance training and development programs.</li>
                    <li>The school calendar should be organized well so that the students can plan their studies effectively.</li>
                    <li>Government should institute a reward system for outstanding ethical behavior. Individuals displaying outstanding acts of disciplined behavior should be rewarded in status, cash, and kind.</li>
                    <li>Measures should be put in place to prevent undue interference in appointments, postings, and promotions in the civil service of Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>The autonomy of the civil services should be provided, similar to the practice in developed countries like the United Kingdom. The civil service should remain non-partisan and not get committed to party leadership.</li>
                    <li>Efforts should be geared towards appointing leadership in the civil service and in the country with both integrity and competence, individuals who can be looked up to by the people with respect instead of disdain as at present.</li>
                </ol>
