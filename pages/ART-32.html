            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the result, the following discoveries have been made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Television programmes can promote tourism. Television, as mentioned in the earlier chapters, is one of the fastest and most spectacular means of communication. Therefore, it has a great impact on society. Any message conveyed on television can spread among the public rapidly, providing evidence that television can play a role in the promotion of culture and tourism.</li>
                    <li>News reporters also have a role in promoting culture and tourism by drawing the government's attention to the development of cultural and tourist sites, especially man-made areas. Properly packaged information can emphasize the importance of television in promoting culture in Plateau State (Government).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In conclusion, the researcher has found that television plays a vital role in the promotion of culture and tourism in Plateau State through improved television programs such as drama, documentaries, adverts, and news reports. The government also has a role to play in this regard, but since the government has neglected this cause, it is the duty of the television stations to serve as a reminder and emphasize the need for the government to address the situation.</p>
