            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study examined the impact of herdsmen and farmers' conflict on the economic development of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State. The nature of the farmers-herdsmen conflict, the causes of the conflict, and the role of the government in addressing the conflict constituted the objectives of the study.</p>
                <p>A review of the literature was extensively carried out using both conceptual and empirical approaches in Chapter Two. This was done to place the study in its proper context and to create a link between it and related studies by updating and contributing to the existing body of knowledge in the field. The review gave insight into concepts such as arable cropping, conflict, and crisis, etc. In the chapter, a theoretical framework was introduced to relate the study to theories. The theories examined were the conflict theory and the frustration-aggression theory.</p>
                <p>The study made use of solely secondary methods of data collection. Secondary data was sourced from textbooks, journal articles, the internet, magazines, commission reports, and newspapers.</p>
                <p>Chapter Three was the methodology of the study, which includes the population of the study, the sample size and sampling techniques, the method of data collection, and instruments of data presentation and analysis.</p>
                <p>Findings of the research reveal that climate change, encroachment on areas of land reserved for grazing by farmers and consequent encroachment on farms by breeders, the breakdown in traditional conflict resolution mechanisms of land and water disputes, and the proliferation of small arms and crime in rural areas are factors that have contributed to the clashes that occur between herdsmen and farmers. Chapter Five provides a summary of the chapters in the study.</p>
                <p>Findings from the study revealed that factors that contributed to the farmers-herdsmen crisis can be attributed to both herdsmen and farmers. Findings revealed that climate change, encroachment on areas of land reserved for grazing by farmers and consequent encroachment on farms by breeders, the proliferation of small arms and crime in rural areas, etc. are determining factors for the crisis.</p>
                <p>Findings further revealed that although the government has employed various management strategies in an attempt to curb the conflict, all have been to no avail as cases of clashes are still reported on a regular basis with no end in sight. The gaps found in the government strategies have been outlined, including the absence of preventive measures as regards the conflict, non-implementation of policies, non-promotion of religious tolerant strategies, and the absence of grassroots outreach in finding out and implementing solutions to the conflict.</p>
                <p>The study concluded that the management structures, processes, and strategies of the government in addressing the farmers-herdsmen crisis are inadequate to the extent that they are more reactionary than preventive or proactive, have implementation lapses, and are bedeviled by political exclusion.</p>
