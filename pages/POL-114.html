            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the analysis and interpretation of data, it shows that conflict is inevitable in an organization because whenever two or more people interact, there is bound to be conflict, as one may go against others' decisions. The following findings were drawn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a need for management to meet the needs and aspirations of its workers, such as wages and salary, fringe benefits, working conditions, housing allowance, transport, dressing allowance, etc. Workers should give their best in carrying out their responsibilities diligently.</li>
                    <li>Conflict can be seen as an avenue for positive change in an organization because ideas are cross-fertilized on how to achieve certain objectives, and problems are identified during conflicts.</li>
                    <li>The use of power by the management is not very satisfying to employees.</li>
                    <li>There is mutual cooperation between management and employees no matter the conflict; there is a certain degree of understanding between them.</li>
                    <li>Productivity is bound to decline if conflict is not brought under control and managed, affecting the organization's growth.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The effect of conflict management in an organization is one of the vital keys that management of any organization must take seriously to improve productivity and achieve the organization's set goals. There should be mutual cooperation between management and workers, even though conflicts may arise from time to time.</p>
                <p>Proper practice of industrial relations, particularly at the government level, depends on many factors, one of which is the ability to cooperate with and make use of shop stewards. Management must recognize the factors that can give rise to conflict in the workplace to avoid a fall in productivity and growth development and must be able to deal with them expeditiously, for example, working conditions, staff welfare, and security of tenure.</p>
                <p>Organizations are made up of individual actors who must interact with one another to achieve the cooperative objectives of the organization. These personal objectives may agree with that of the organization but often are at variance. Since these various individuals are employees of the same organization, their ambitions are to pursue the respective objectives while subsuming them under the cooperative objectives.</p>
                <p>One must be aware that conflict of interest in any organization is inevitable. Individuals come from different backgrounds (education, religious, and social status), and they must be classified into different units or departments to contribute to the growth and development of the organization.</p>
