            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study focuses on the use of libraries for academic performance in Nigeria, with a particular focus on Plateau State Polytechnic, Barkin Ladi. The findings of the study are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The school library provides about ten library services that enhance educational development, but students are only aware of or have utilized four of these services. The disconnect may be due to a lack of awareness of the existence of many services or restricted access to them. Efforts are needed to create awareness of library services in school libraries.</li>
                    <li>The library services provided to students are not adequately utilized, which could have negative effects on both the library and the students. Low utilization may be due to the provision of irrelevant services or the students' unawareness of these services.</li>
                    <li>Library services have a positive impact on students' academic performance and educational development. Adequate provision and utilization of these services can make students more active in class, reduce the time spent on leisure activities, improve exam performance, enhance information search skills, promote reading habits, and equip students to use the library and the Internet effectively.</li>
                    <li>Several challenges face school library services, hindering their positive effects on students' educational development. These challenges include inadequate provision and low utilization of library services, lack of knowledge about the importance of library use, librarians' wrong attitudes, students' negative attitudes, absence of guidance on library usage, insufficient funding for library programs, lack of library staff, inadequate reading materials, limited library space, strict library policies, and lack of support from management and teachers for students to use the library.</li>
