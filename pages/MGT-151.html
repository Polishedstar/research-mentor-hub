            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of the study, some facts were established based on findings, and the summary of the analyses are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That quality control system has an impact on organizational efficiency in a manufacturing company.</li>
                    <li>That effective quality satisfies customer wants and needs.</li>
                    <li>That quality control is significant to the organization's turnover rate.</li>
                    <li>That effective personnel training has a positive effect on product quality.</li>
                    <li>That a total quality control system reduces the rate of scraps and wastage of material in the organization.</li>
                    <li>That quality control has a significant effect on the cost of a particular product.</li>
                    <li>That the process involved in the quality control system of the organization is through conformance to specification and product testing.</li>
                    <li>That quality control is a strategy for maintaining product standards.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Achieving high quality does not happen by accident. The production process must be properly managed to achieve quality standards. To establish and run an effective quality control unit, the quality control manager requires managerial skills and a sound knowledge of science and technology.</p>
                <p>Quality has to be something that is considered from the very beginning and built into everything that a business or organization does. Planning carefully, monitoring your work, and constant re-evaluation and adjustment are all extremely important. You don't ensure quality by catching mistakes before they reach the customer. You ensure it by setting up a system in which you don't make the mistakes to begin with.</p>
