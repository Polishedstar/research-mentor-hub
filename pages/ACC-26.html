            <h2>Background to the Study</h2>
                <p>The basic aim of this study is to research on the contribution of commercial banks to the development of small-scale industries. The activities of the banking system in most countries remain the lifewire in the development of business enterprises and economic growth of the country. Small business enterprises can be found in all sectors of the economy such as manufacturing, services, retailing, wholesaling, agriculture, construction, and the likes. It is worthy of note that small-scale businesses are not restricted to the industrial sector of the economy, which is now stagnant.</p>
                <p>There have been changes in the performance of the banking system over the past years in Nigeria. These changes are either positive or negative. The Nigeria Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) was established in 1964 to restructure investment companies in Nigeria and to provide credit and other facilities to industries, particularly small, medium, and large-scale industries.</p>
                <p>The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was established in 1958 and started operations on the 1st of July 1987. The Bank has over the years been playing a leading role in the promotion of small-scale industries. The interest rates on loans for small-scale industry are lower than those of other sectors of the economy.</p>
                <p>The Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (NBCI) also helps to finance businesses through the provision of funds for the acquisition of fixed assets. The Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB), formerly the Nigeria Agricultural and Cooperative Bank Limited (NACB), was established in 1973 to provide financial services to the agricultural sector of the economy and it invests in the equity of some major agro-allied companies.</p>
