            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was undertaken to examine the effect of office technology skills on students' performance.</p>
            
                <p>The study revealed the following findings among others:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The office technology skills required by OTM students include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to use various computer application software</li>
                        <li>Electronic mail (e-mail)</li>
                        <li>Machine technology skills</li>
                        <li>Electronic record management skills</li>
                        <li>Competence in the use of various telecommunication applications and devices</li>
                        <li>Ability to use various reprographic devices</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Office technology skills provide:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Greater exposure to vocational and workforce skills</li>
                        <li>Opportunities for the use of multiple technologies during training</li>
                        <li>Greater enthusiasm for skill acquisition amongst OTM students</li>
                        <li>Preparation of OTM students for the real world of work and to cope with the realities of the modern work environment</li>
                        <li>Encouragement of innovation and creativity in school and at the workplace</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The acquisition of office technology skills is challenged by factors such as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inadequate technological devices and equipment for the training of office technology managers</li>
                        <li>Lack of skill or capacity on the part of the trainers</li>
                        <li>Unwillingness to adopt new technological innovation by trainers</li>
                        <li>Overemphasis laid by trainers on theory instead of concentrating more on stimulating real-life experience</li>
                        <li>Inadequate public power supply</li>
                        <li>Poor and non-sustainable funding due to dwindling revenue</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Strategies for improved acquisition of office technology skills include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provision of adequate technological devices and equipment for the training of office technology managers</li>
                        <li>Technical training and retraining programs for trainers</li>
                        <li>Trainers should be willing to adopt new technological innovation</li>
                        <li>Emphasis should be placed more on practicals rather than theory during training</li>
                        <li>Provide alternative sources of electricity supply</li>
                        <li>Adopt active private sector involvement in funding OTM training</li>
