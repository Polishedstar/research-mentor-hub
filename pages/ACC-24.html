            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
              <p>In the Nigeria banking industry, where an extra pressure is set on banks' profitability, the design of the right corporate governance system is a must for banks that want to be successful in the new competitive environment. But if banks are unlike other firms, as it has been long postulated by the economic literature, we may also wonder whether this singularity affects research that investigates the governance mechanism in the particular case of the banking industry. This research reviewed the academic literature that studied the corporate governance problem in the banking industry, analyzing its different features and the argued reasons behind them, as well as the impact on banks' workers.</p>
              <p>Corporate governance has come to stay as a vital concept needed to achieve efficiency, increased productivity, and growth in the banking industry. The key wealth creation and the maintenance of a free society require that a board system of accountability be integrated into the corporate governance of corporations and the banking sectors. Good corporate governance provides:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>High and sustainable profit</li>
                  <li>Competent staff</li>
                  <li>Good service delivery</li>
                  <li>Protection of shareholders' rights</li>
                  <li>Sustenance of stakeholders' confidence</li>
                  <li>Effective succession plan for top management and board members</li>
                  <li>Robust risk management systems and reduced overall risk.</li>
              </ul>
