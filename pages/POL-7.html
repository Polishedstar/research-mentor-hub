            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>That skills acquisition promotes economic development in Plateau State, thereby bringing positive changes in the economy of the state with increasing technological progress, high capital savings, high rates of investment, efficiency in production and innovations of techniques, high levels of output, steady economic growth, and an increase in GDP.</li>
                    <li>That NDE contributes/encourages skills acquisition in the state, meaning that NDE has a trail in the area of youth's empowerment and vocational skills development. Job creation, sensitization, and re-orientation of graduates to take up self-employment instead of wage employment.</li>
                    <li>That skills acquisition and innovation are at the peak of awareness in Plateau State and Nigeria at large, hence receiving more attention from government and the private sector.</li>
                    <li>Finally, research reveals that inadequate power supply and lack of adequate infrastructural amenities are still serious challenges to entrepreneurs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Skills acquisition is seen as the driving force for innovation and job creation in an emerging economy. Their small size makes them very sensitive to changes in the industry and environment in which they operate. That is why emphasis was placed on the need to facilitate the development of small enterprises by NDE in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Government through the NDE acknowledges the dynamic capacity of small enterprises, particularly when it comes to providing new services, creating jobs, and fostering social and economic development. Thus, stressing the importance of skills acquisition. In order to stimulate skills acquisition and improve the business environment for small enterprises, NDE initiated a number of programs to champion her campaign in this regard.</p>
                <p>Skills acquisition contributes/encourages economic development in the sense that it characterizes innovation and brings about technical progress. Efficient production techniques and a higher level of output or economic growth which stimulate industrialization.</p>
