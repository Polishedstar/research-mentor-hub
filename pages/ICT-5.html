            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the above discussion, it can be summarized that ICT literacy encompasses the dimensions of technology brought about by such developments as computers, networks, and the internet, as well as the ability of staff to use these technologies to create value. This includes the use of computers and other communication tools such as e-mail, video conferencing, and the worldwide web (www) for the location of information and the subsequent dissemination of information to users.</p>
            
                <p>In order to meet the challenges of globalization and keep abreast of trends in modern information service delivery systems, library staff in Nigerian universities should be equipped with the requisite skill, which is ICT literacy. This literacy, when acquired, will improve their job performance and the overall service delivery to users.</p>
