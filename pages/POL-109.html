            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study investigated youth as agents of nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria. Based on the analysis of the study, the following summary of findings were drawn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That youths are agents of nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>That youth play a role in nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>That youth contributed to nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria to a large extent.</li>
                    <li>That the strategies for youth towards nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria are youth empowerment, youth involvement in decision making, training and development, and community asset mapping.</li>
                    <li>That the government encourages youth through N-Power programme, N-YES programme, Sure-P programme, and NDE programme towards nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>That youth face the challenges of inequality, corruption, bad governance, lack of youth empowerment, and uninvolvement of youth in decision making in nation-building and national transformation in Nigeria.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the above, it is clear that young people are the greatest asset of any nation. They are the future of any nation and serve as the bridge that links the present to future generations. They are active, dynamic, and adventurous and can serve as agents of social action and social change.</p>
                <p>However, there is no doubt that the elders have failed to put in place effective development programs for the youth. It remains to be seen whether the youth will fail themselves and refuse to develop themselves and become agents of change. Leadership for change and entrepreneurship are imperative for young people to perform their historic role of being agents of social action and change in society. It was Frantz Fanon who said: "Every generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it." The past is gone. The future is a clean slate. Nigeria is at a juncture. The choice is yours - fulfill your mission or betray it.</p>
