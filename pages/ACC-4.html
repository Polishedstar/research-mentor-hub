            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>As a guide towards achieving the objective of this study, the research revises relevant literature of various authorities in the field of electronic banking. The relevant laws and acts were equally reviewed.</p>
                <p>For easy understanding, the researcher adopted the random sampling method, which gives the entire population as has been pointed out in chapter three.</p>
                <p>The data collected through primary and secondary sources were clearly presented and analyzed in chapter four. The following findings were reviewed in the analysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The introduction of electronic banking to Nigerian banks has yielded positive effects. Banks have been able to detect and track down individuals involved in various forms of financial crimes or other activities through their e-security devices.</li>
                    <li>Electronic banking, at the initial stage, was seen as a nuisance, but gradually, as it spread its wings wider, its acceptance has grown, giving banks a sense of relief.</li>
                    <li>As an assured tool for security control, e-banking is foreseen to be fully recognized and accepted in the near future.</li>
                    <li>Banks have achieved a lot from e-banking as it helps them deal with financial crimes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nevertheless, efforts should not be relented in trying to get the best out of this technological development.</p>
