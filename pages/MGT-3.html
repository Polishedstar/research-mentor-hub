                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>During the course of this research work, the following findings evolved:</p>
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>
                                <p>That Zenith Bank Plc can develop an effective marketing strategy that will retain, motivate, and stimulate their customers to beat any kind of competition in the banking industry.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>It is clear that the environment in which commercial banking operates has changed drastically in terms of customerâ€™s attitude, service, structure, offering, promotion method, and approach, etc. The banks now shift to attracting and retaining customers by developing an appropriate promotional message that sells with all its attendant complexities.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>That the image of Zenith Bank is promoted by its marketing strategy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>That marketing research will help Zenith Bank Plc to identify a strategy that will improve the relationship between Zenith Bank and its customers.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Also, there is competition in terms of innovation of one service or the other by new banks who are proving to be more efficient than the existing ones.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>An enterprise can operate without a profit for some time, but not a single day can it operate without a customer. Customers are the determinant of the existence of a bank.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
