            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study found out that journalists play a role in crisis management in the way they report. They can contribute to the escalation or reduction of crisis.</p>
                <p>The study also found out that journalists, therefore, qualify as actors. There is evidence that stakeholders have attempted to reach out to journalists in an attempt to deal with crises.</p>
                <p>The study also found out that reports by journalists are critical in that they highlight the plight of victims by exposing the key players in a given crisis. On the other hand, journalists and the media have played the role of peace agents by ensuring that governments act to prevent the escalation of crises when they report on existing crisis situations and by calling for possible solutions to the crisis.</p>
                <p>The study further found out that the links between journalists and crises were very close, and journalists had to balance by presenting the two opposing views and having the public judge. Further, journalists helped in containing crises by exercising crisis-sensitive reporting guided by their various Code of Conduct and professional ethics. They reported responsibly by being neutral, making reports that helped the conflicting parties understand each other's predicaments, and engaging the community in peace initiatives through sensitizing the people about the dangers of engaging in crises.</p>
                <p>The study also found out that the links between journalists and crises were very close, and journalists had to balance by presenting the two opposing views and having the public be the judge. On the other hand, journalists fueled and protected crises by showing people how their people were being killed and could protect by airing peace. However, the study found out that journalists do not fuel crises.</p>
                <p>The study further found out that journalists helped in containing crises due to good crisis-sensitive reporting in a crisis situation. On the other hand, the study found out that journalists could negatively engage in crises through inciting and taking sides, being subjective, not being factual, airing steaming stories that people feel they were being exploited by the other group, and serving the interests of parties that may be paying them.</p>
                <p>The study found out that journalists were aware of their role in crises, and they understood their role in crisis situations. Players in crises understood the role of journalists in crises. Further, crisis managers considered journalists as key players in crises and brought journalists to the table in crisis management strategies.</p>
                <p>The study found out that stakeholders attempted to reach out to journalists to deal with crises. Journalism colleges train journalists on crisis management, and the concept of crisis-sensitive journalism or reporting has been embraced in the media sector. The level of efficiency was directly proportional to the level of journalists' involvement, which has often been limited to press releases, press conferences, and interviews with journalists.</p>
                <p>The study found out that crisis managers should consider journalists as key players in crises and provide them with necessary information. Further, they should hold meetings to discuss how best to air the crises, involve journalists in solving and managing crises, be seen as parties, not outsiders, act as a medium for informing the public about what parties are doing about the crisis, and influence either positively or negatively, even creating mass movements or revolutions and changing a situation from worse to good or vice versa.</p>
