            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between government expenditure on agriculture and its contribution to economic growth in Nigeria from 1989-2014. The variables used are government expenditure on agriculture, agriculture output, and central bank loan.</p>
            
                <p>Although the share of agriculture in total government expenditure is relatively low, the actual expenditure has been on the increase. In fact, a huge amount of resources has been pumped into the agricultural sector on paper in Nigeria within the last decades. The issue is the extent to which these expenditures actually go for what they are meant. The leakages in the sector, as with nearly all government expenditures, could be very high, accounting for the low response of the sector to increased expenditures. But in general, the financing policies and programmed of government for agriculture have had mixed results.</p>
            
                <p>In the 70s, Nigeria started what could be considered a determined effort to transform the agricultural sector. Efforts to rehabilitate oil palm and cocoa growing activities resulted in some improvements in the performance of these commodities. While, further agricultural growth was constrained by high cost and shortages of some inputs such as ploughs, hand pumps, tractors, fishing outboard engines, chemicals, and livestock vaccines, and high-yield variety seeds, most of which are imported.</p>
            
                <p>Though government expenditure for agricultural development is needed, first, to supplement private investment capital which is generally not adequate in peasant production systems due to the low capital base and level of savings and second to influence the pace of agricultural modernization which may be relatively low if left exclusively to private producers, of course, in the process of doing these things, government provides a stock of facilities which need to be maintained on a current basis. While agricultural credit, on the other hand, is needed by the farmer to take advantage of modern farming techniques and for financing production processes such as storage and processing, particularly where production is largely seasonal. Much as these financial needs for agricultural production have been recognized in Nigeria, several constraints have prevented the smooth flow of capital to the agricultural sector.</p>
            
                <p>It is as a result of these lingering problems, which severely limit agricultural output that this research work has tried to find direction toward what is actually responsible for the persistence in the reduction of the agricultural sector.</p>
            
                <p>Government at different times had put in place different policies, programs, and credit facilities. Such facilities were supposed to make loans available to peasant farmers, who neither have the necessary collateral nor steady source of income for the financial institutions. These institutions were profit-oriented and abhor losses; they find it very hard to give loans to the peasant farmers, and when it is made available, the credit is either not used properly or allocated to the wrong farmers. These problems affect the government credit agencies, both at the state and national levels.</p>
            
                <p>In this study, it has been revealed that the country has had various policies and programs designed since the 1970s and one of such is the ADPs.</p>
            
                <p>The ADPs (Agricultural Development Projects) represented the first major practical demonstration of the integrated approach to agricultural development in Nigeria. The scheme was launched in various parts of the country between 1973 and 1985. The strategy in the ADPs was to provide essential modern inputs and facilitating services and structures to producers with a view to achieving more satisfactory rates of increase in production of mainly food crops in each project area.</p>
            
                <p>On the part of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), its basic purpose was to rectify the inappropriate past macro and micro policies so as to entrench sustainable economic growth. A good agricultural sector performance was expected to be an important factor in the attainment of the overall goal of SAP which was to; alter and realign the aggregate domestic expenditure and the structure of production; with a view to minimizing import dependence, diversifying the export base and achieving stable and balanced economic development. The agricultural sector was to generate a significant increase in production to meet domestic food needs, local raw materials requirements encourage exports and raise rural income and employment.</p>
            
                <p>It is clear that the agricultural sector depends on foreign innovations for its growth without which agricultural production would be reduced to a purely traditional activity, which is likely to perform below expectations. The over-dependence on the outside world for innovations is a constraint that needs to be addressed; otherwise, no meaningful adjustment can take place. This again takes us back to the domain of agricultural policy. To look inwards, policy actions must resolve the issue of structural transformation of the agricultural sector with regard to technological progress. The nature of the agricultural research and extension systems will be critical, while the role of appropriate technologies whether adapted or developed is equally important. A perspective plan of agricultural development must incorporate these issues.</p>
