            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The objective of this study, as stated earlier, was to identify how the marketing function of Eco-Bank Plc is performed and the extent to which it has affected its profitability. The study aimed to examine and evaluate the various marketing techniques and tools employed by the bank, with a view to measure their effectiveness on the overall performance of the bank. Recommendations are provided where necessary, for improving or rectifying areas of weakness.</p>
                <p>The researcher commenced by giving a brief introduction and review of the relevant literature on the topical area. Marketing was looked into, both as a business function and as a business philosophy. This was followed by an examination of the major characteristics of financial services, the marketing concept, bank marketing objectives, and the marketing of financial/banking services in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>The researcher then proceeded to highlight and design protocols for data collection and analysis, along with the scope and limitations of the study. This was followed by a brief overview of Eco-Bank Plc and its marketing organization.</p>
                <p>Finally, after data collection and analysis, the findings were briefly summarized.</p>
                <p>As opined by Nwankwo, as the economy expands and develops, old horizons will unfold, and new opportunities and challenges will open up. The environment will have no room for the stagnant banker, hamstrung with age-old traditions. The day will be carried by the progressive and dynamic banker who is always improving his skills, constantly scanning the environment, and identifying customersâ€™ needs, thus managing his resources to meet diverse and competing priorities. This cannot be possible without effective marketing.</p>
                <p>Understanding the financial environment and responding successfully to the resultant competitive influences will increasingly differentiate the successful institution from the rest. This exemplifies the so-called "failure" or success syndrome; successful policies in the past may not work in the same manner when conditions change. Of course, this does not mean that more traditional banking strengths and policies are now redundant. Traditional strengths must be exploited in a way that is appropriate to new conditions and technological developments.</p>
                <p>Eco-Bank Plc seems to have come to terms with this fact from inception. It has involved a marketing culture that transcends and permeates every nook and cranny of the organization. The bank has financial and technical resources, innovative ability, the determination to provide customers with the required services, the expertise for sophisticated and intricate financial operations, and a well-developed armory of skills and technology that the management of a modern institution of this nature calls for. All these have culminated in the excellent overall performance by the bank.</p>
