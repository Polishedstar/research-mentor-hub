            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It was ascertained that due to lack of education in those days and ignorance of education in the present day, there have been some major factors reframing both parents and the girl child's sense, and other factors such as culture, in general, that affect the girl child's education and population as a result of early marriage. According to Dr. Ekwembu's research, it was pointed out that a vast number of young girls who suffered during labor were teenagers aged 13-19 years who endured labor for up to five days before delivery. Lawson (1967) and Aloyebi et al. (1976) elaborated more about the repercussions of early marriage, especially in terms of vesicovaginal fistula, which is a pathological condition.</p>
                <p>Data were collected from documents, reports, questionnaires, interviews, which were used for the study. It is expected that culture and belief systems would change regarding the girl child's marriage for the betterment of her studies.</p>
                <p>To conclude this research work, a lot of findings have emerged from the study, and many people now have a better understanding of early marriage and its causes. The understanding of the individual, families, community, and society at large regarding its impact on the girl child's education has been addressed.</p>
                <p>Based on this research work, the researcher was able to discover that early marriage has health effects on female individuals, particularly vesicovaginal fistula, which is the abnormal opening from the bladder into the vaginal area. This condition is common among ladies who get married without being fully matured to bear and deliver successfully, as mentioned by the respondents.</p>
