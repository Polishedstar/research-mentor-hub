            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p><strong>a. Online newspaper readership impacts newsgathering in The Tide Newspaper:</strong> Reporters in The Tide are not only cognizant of online news readers by covering issues that are popular on social media in the course of newsgathering, but also make use of user-generated contents (UGC) from online news readers as sources of information.</p>
                <p><strong>b. Online readership of newspaper does not impact news editing in The Tide:</strong> Editors consider that news reports will be read online; however, they ultimately do not require reporters to file reports in ways that make such reports suitable for online reading and do not shorten or re-write stories to be published online.</p>
                <p><strong>c. Online newspaper readership does not impact the number of hard copies printed on publication days in The Tide:</strong> A switch from daily to thrice-a-week publication of the print version and reduction of the number of print copies to 1000 copies are found not to be attributable to online readership of The Tide newspaper.</p>
                <p><strong>d. Online newspaper readership does not impact operating revenue in The Tide:</strong> It has neither positively nor negatively affected advertising revenue nor the sale of print copies in the newspaper.</p>
