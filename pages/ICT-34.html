            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the analysis and based on factors collected in the course of this research work, several findings were made and are being summarized to affirm the connection between Information and Communication Technology and security management in Nigeria. ICT in Nigeria Police Force, Plateau State Command, is, in many respects, a success story in spite of the obvious constraints. Some of these constraints include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Low level of literacy on the use of ICT</li>
                    <li>Most applications are not user-friendly to the personnel of the force</li>
                    <li>Poor state of ICT facilities in the command</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The government and the authority of the Nigeria Police Force have accordingly embarked on measures aimed at addressing some of the constraints, such as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Provision of ICT facilities as a priority in the Nigeria Police Force</li>
                    <li>Recent purchases of security equipment, such as walkie-talkies and Hilux vans for the ICT department</li>
                    <li>Provision of more satellite cables and masks</li>
                    <li>Creation of a department named "G" department that will solely take care of communication technology in Nigeria</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The commitment of the authority of the Nigeria Police Force, headed by the present Inspector General of Police M.D Abubakar, is also an added advantage to the success of ICT in the Nigeria Police Force. It means that at the top, ICT requires leadership with visionary men and women who are able to set long-term goals, develop strategies to bring about fundamental and adoptive change, and motivate increasingly independent, highly knowledgeable, and geographically dispersed people to achieve corporate mission, vision, and goals. This is achieved through management roles, ensuring periodic symposiums, workshops, seminars, and conferences on ICT training for its staff and personnel to enhance productivity and effective policing.</p>
                <p>One paramount fundamental transformation in the use of ICT in the Nigeria Police Force, Plateau State Command, Jos, is that it enhances performance in terms of improved intelligence gathering and detection of offenders in the society.</p>
