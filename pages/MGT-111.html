            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Looking at the analysis of the data collected from the field, it shows that 60% of respondents in question 2 inferred that packaging is very important in protecting the product from damage and facilitating transportation from one destination to another. It also serves other functions, such as communicating with the target market. Most customers, both educated and illiterate, can identify a product with ease through its packaging. These functions help organizations increase their sales volume, as shown in question A, table 4 of the organization questionnaire.</p>
                <p>Despite the importance of packaging to both customers and organizations, the research shows that packaging can constitute a nuisance to society. This is evident in question (table 6) of the customers' questionnaire, where 23 respondents strongly agreed that packaging has an effect on the environment due to the way it litters our surroundings, which often leads to environmental pollution.</p>
                <p>The researcher also collected responses on whether packaging should be discouraged or not. However, most respondents indicated that packaging should not be discouraged because of its importance, which was outlined earlier.</p>
                <p>Thus, 75% of respondents in table 5 of the customers' table stated that instead of avoiding packaging, organizations should use packaging that can be easily destroyed, educate customers on the importance of disposing of packaging properly, and avoid using packaging that is deceptive.</p>
                <p>This research paper investigated the social responsibility issues in packaging consumer products, with a special reference to Nasco Pack Nigeria Ltd. The results of the study revealed that packaging has a significant effect on the sales volume of an organization and, at the same time, has a negative impact on our environment.</p>
                <p>The results found that packaging is an effective communication tool that conveys messages about the products to consumers, helps transport products, and prevents damage. On the other hand, packaging can litter our environment, creating health hazards. Our streets are often littered with packaging materials that will not decay for many years, leading to solid waste disposal problems.</p>
                <p>It's worth mentioning that some packaging can be deceptive, as small quantities of goods are packaged in large containers to make the product appear larger. This can mislead customers into spending a significant amount of money on a small quantity of the product.</p>
                <p>Despite these problems, packaging should not be banned considering its importance to customers and organizations. Marketers must take into consideration these social responsibility issues when packaging their products.</p>
