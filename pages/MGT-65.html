            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work was critically designed to determine the impact of pricing policy on marketing of an organization product using Unilever Nigeria Plc as a case study.</p>
                <p>Price, which is the only mix that generates revenue to the organization where other mix represents costs, it is therefore imperative for an organization to handle its pricing policies appropriately and effectively. This will help the organization to maximize profit, maintain market share, and actively compete in the market.</p>
                <p>It is discovered in this research that Unilever Nigeria Limited's success is a result of its effective pricing policy. Its policy is not too rigid nor too flexible, but the company reviews its prices based on environmental factors such as the cost of production, other marketing mix, economic conditions, technological factors, etc.</p>
                <p>However, the conclusion of these findings indicates that price influences customers positively or negatively because when the price is reviewed upward, most customers will lower their patronage, and if the price is reviewed downward, most customers do increase their patronage of the product.</p>
                <p>From the analysis of data, it is concluded that price is an effective tool that influences customers to patronize an organization. If the pricing policy is not favorable to customers, they tend to lower their patronage which will, in turn, mar the success of the organization because customers will always go for substitutes that are affordable.</p>
                <p>Appropriate and effective pricing determines an organization's maximization of profit, maintaining its market share, and actively competing in the market. This, therefore, means that an organization must give priority to its pricing policy for it to be able to achieve its corporate goals.</p>
