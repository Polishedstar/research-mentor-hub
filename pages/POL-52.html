            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Traditional rulers played a vital role in ethnic crises management in Barkin Local Government Area of Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>Transformation of conflict is very expedient for organizations to turn conflicts into the basis of future cooperation among social entities.</li>
                    <li>The causes of conflict in Nigeria are politically motivated, ethnicity, religious, and resource control.</li>
                    <li>Herdsmen and farmer clashes, religion-motivated and ethnicity are the factors fueling violent conflicts in Barkin Local Government Area.</li>
                    <li>The efforts made by traditional rulers in Barkin Local Government Area in conflict management and conflict resolution bring about reconciliation, reconstruction, and rehabilitation as is the case in many local governments, organizations in Nigeria, and human life in general.</li>
                    <li>The present socio-economic conditions of the local people in the local government are not satisfactory despite conflict management strategies in place.</li>
                    <li>The strategies adopted by the Traditional rulers in combating crises are effective.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As inferred from the study, conflict management is the process of limiting the negative aspects of conflict while increasing its positive aspects. It is the principle that all conflicts cannot necessarily be resolved, but learning how to manage conflicts can decrease the odds of nonproductive escalation. Transformation of conflict is also very expedient for us to turn conflicts into the basis of future cooperation among social entities.</p>
                <p>Traditional conflict management and peacebuilding practices reflect principles of reconciliation based on long-term conflict transformation, peaceable relationships, and values. These customary efforts seem to be effective in addressing intra-community and even inter-community conflicts where relationships and shared values form the bases of the reconciliation processes.</p>
                <p>The challenge facing the Nigerian nation is how to make conflicts constructive rather than destructive, marginal rather than fundamental, peripheral rather than pivotal. The Nigerian government must address the root causes of conflicts in the polity - the historic wrongs and injustice that engender strife and conflicts - build a pluralist democratic state where the rights of all citizens are respected, seek to blend power with principle and reconcile authority with freedom, and put a robust Peace Infrastructure in place to play a preventive and mitigating role.</p>
