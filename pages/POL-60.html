            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the analysis of the findings of this study, it was evident that the African Union (AU) has played a significant role in the resolution of conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Darfur region of Sudan, through the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), a peacekeeping and peacemaking initiative.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that the African Union pact provides an effective instrument not only for resolving intra/inter-state conflicts through peaceful means of negotiation, conciliation, mediation, and arbitration as enshrined in the UN and OAU charters, but it has also established a viable collective security and common defense arrangement in the African region.</p>
                <p>However, the study also revealed that there are many problems inhibiting the African Union in its peacekeeping operations. Some of these problems include the absence of political consensus, logistical challenges, and unfamiliarity with the terrains, which is often followed by hostility from rebel groups.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the analysis has provided insight into the fact that despite the above-mentioned problems and criticism, the organization has indeed achieved a lot within a short time, particularly in the area of conflict resolution. The Darfur region, in particular, has been significantly stabilized, preventing it from degenerating into genocide. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement, and it has demonstrated the utility of regional groups in maintaining peace and security not only in Africa but also in assisting in other parts of the world.</p>
