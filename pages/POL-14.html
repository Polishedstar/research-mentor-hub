            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study emphasizes the importance and need for effective and efficient budgeting in Mangu Local Government Council. The following are the summary of findings made from the study:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Budgeting enhances efficient management of finance for effective service delivery in Mangu Local Government Council.</li>
                    <li>The relationship between budgeting and service delivery in Mangu Local Government Council is excellent.</li>
                    <li>Budgeting affects the process of expenditure and control in Mangu Local Government Council.</li>
                    <li>The major problems of budgeting for service delivery and financial management in Mangu Local Government Council are planning, management, and implementation.</li>
                    <li>There are effective control measures in budgeting in Mangu Local Government Council.</li>
                    <li>Budgeting performs a significant function in the Local Government.</li>
                    <li>Budgeting systems partially solve the problem of future uncertainty in the Local Government.</li>
                    <li>Any managerial decision about budgets that is not properly made can result in inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the organization (failure).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Budget committees should be set up to ensure that budgets are implemented based on the approved budget and to ascertain that money spent is not more than what is approved in the budget. Different control measures should be put in place where there are deviations of actual performance from the standards, called variances. These variances should be grouped into favorable and unfavorable categories, and corrective measures should be put in place to control the variances.</p>
