            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the data analyzed in previous chapters, the researcher discovered the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It was revealed that after-sale service is the marketing activity performed after a sale has been made, a means of deep insight into customers, purchased goods, and bedrock of customers’ relationship with the organization.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that after-sale service influences the purchase of industrial goods because it leads to effective utilization of purchased goods. After-sale service has provided customer satisfaction, customers' relaxation, and continuous patronage, thereby encouraging customers’ loyalty.</li>
                    <li>It also revealed that after-sale service reduces customers' cost of maintenance on purchased industrial goods through preventive maintenance.</li>
                    <li>After-sale service increases the profitability and market share of any competitive market, as increased patronage of industrial goods leads to higher profitability and market share.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From the above findings, the impact of after-sale service cannot be over-emphasized. Companies need after-sale service to stay ahead of their competition. A well-executed after-sale service should increase the relationship between the company and its customers, aligning with the company’s objectives and goals. A deep insight into customers' purchased goods and the bedrock of customers’ relationship with the organization was one among many findings.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, despite the challenges faced by after-sale service in the purchase of industrial goods, the service has a significant impact on customers and the organization. This impact includes customer satisfaction, cost reduction, and acting as feedback for an organization's products and services.</p>
