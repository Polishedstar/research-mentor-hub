            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>After completing all the processes of carrying out the research, we present here our findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Global economic meltdown has a negative impact on the performance of manufacturing industries, particularly Coca-Cola.</li>
                    <li>Coca-Cola plc witnessed a high increase in unsold stocks and an increase in bank rates and charges as a result of the global economic meltdown.</li>
                    <li>The turnover of Coca-Cola and profit margin of 2005-2006 was higher than that of 2007-2010, which witnessed the effects of the global economic recession.</li>
                    <li>Just like most countries, the Nigerian economy suffered from the global economic meltdown, particularly the financial market and manufacturing.</li>
                    <li>Despite the global economic meltdown, businesses can still record huge success in their transactions through diversification of the investment portfolio.</li>
                    <li>Potential manufacturers were discouraged from engaging in small-scale businesses during the economic meltdown period due to an increase in interest rates and bank charges.</li>
                </ol>
