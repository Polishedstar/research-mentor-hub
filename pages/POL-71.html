            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The researcher, after a careful presentation, analysis, and interpretations, came up with this summary. It seems necessary now to sum the different segments of the work. In the general sense, therefore, the researcher learned that crisis management is the most accessible and credible source of enlightening, educating, and informing the people of Plateau State. From the analysis gathered in this project, there is no doubt that the Non-governmental organization is strong and plays vital roles in crisis management in Plateau State. Also, the results of the data analysis support that the Non-governmental organization is very relevant and plays an important role in crisis management, even though they are limited by many hindrances. Despite the odds, the researchers were able to arrive at specific and reliable solutions to the research problems.</p>
                <p>From the start of this study, the researcher stated that Non-government organizations have eluded the state and the country at large at many times. Government and multinational companies' inability to create employment opportunities cause crises in an area. Crisis in any environment discourages investment in such a country. Land disputes are a major cause of crisis among ethnic nationalities. Intolerance among ethnic groups is also one of the major causes of crises in any ethnic group in an organization and society.</p>
                <p>Non-governmental initiatives and strategies are very useful in the settlement of crises, but public relations practitioners are not often used in the settlement of crises.</p>
