            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>After careful presentation of data and analysis, the following responses were observed in Chapter four:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Senior management staff makes investment decisions in the organization.</li>
                    <li>The organization invests because of the interest that will accrue from such investment.</li>
                    <li>From the responses, it shows that the organization is rated highly.</li>
                    <li>The organization does not invest because of idle cash.</li>
                    <li>It also shows from the responses that management efficiency is rated high based on decisions made.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the research results so far, the researcher concluded that organizations should invest because of the interest that will accrue from such investment, not because of excess liquidity.</p>
