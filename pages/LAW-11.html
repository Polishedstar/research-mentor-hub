            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>There are, it seems, no split ends to probably end all discussions. But it is always necessary to conclude; even though; the sequence of being gives the impression that there is another beginning from an end. In that wise, the study will summarize those hiccups that the ACJL has come with the aim to ameliorate and which have been discussed in the main text but will in following paragraphs be outlined.</p>
                <p>It is without gainsaying that the problems associated with the administration of criminal justice; law and practice are inherent in its processes of adjudication. Thus, criminal prosecution, investigation, and termination in a particular matter, aside from taking unnecessarily scarce resources and delays to be concluded; there are other intricate and precarious vices that have bedeviled the system. There are the many technical hitches, lacunae, and systemic or institutional failures incident to stymie the operation of the law. Among many others, it suffices to mention that the progress is clogged by criminal justice institutions like the police activities, the ministers in the temple of justice itself, the legal aid council, the prison service, and other law enforcement agencies directly or indirectly connected with the management and administration of criminal justice.</p>
                <p>Against these backgrounds, it has been informed that these lapses are traceable to and have been caused by the government or her employees. That the organs that administer government business like the executive, the legislature, and judiciary are sometimes not favorably disposed, pecuniary motivated, or are handicapped and corrupt. It goes further that the very law that establishes them in a particular situation will not grant total independence, impartiality, and integrity in the case of the judiciary. For instance, workers in the judiciary have a flare for embarking always on strike action. While the legislature is often without a clear-cut orientation and comprehensiveness in any piece of legislation with the peculiarity of Nigerian society and her disposition as a third-world nation enacted laws are seemingly photocopied and pasted into the system without industry.</p>
                <p>It has been said also that there is a peculiarity that exists between law and the society in which the law is to operate. This symbiotic relation is based on the understanding that man discovered or created law; that is, it is man that needed law and therefore to achieve his goals and attain his dreams he enacted laws to further his course as a mechanism of social order. The implication from the sociological jurisprudence point of view is that any piece of legislation must draw its inference from the society; that is, the umbilical cord is and will remain ad infinitum. That the centerpiece of the law should come from the boiling pot of societal activities and conducts, ‘the goings-on’ in the society; chiefly, Roscoe Pound had canvassed for a ministry of justice in any common law country. The import, as has been said in the main text, is that any law which is alien to the people is always incomprehensible to be obeyed and enforced. Law should be peculiar to the dynamics of the society with proper investigation and background check before enactment and allowed to run auto-based without man’s influence and interference except to apply and execute.</p>
                <p>Not forgetting in a hurry, or the issue which on many occasions has incident improper administration of criminal justice in the country, particularly by high-profile and corruption exposed or induced politicians, is the body language of the leader rather than the rule of law dictating the pace of criminal prosecution. In many of these cases, prosecution is only given media attention without properly addressing the problems and thereby weakens the system. This is the absence of objectivity in the prosecution of crimes; rather, the accused persons are presumed guilty until proved otherwise by the court. Aside from stigmatization, persons suspected of crime have all their rights denied by law enforcement officers. It is irrespective of whether the allegations are insinuations, trumped up, and unverifiable investigations. What matters is that somebody has been alleged of graft and the public opinion brays for their blood. This has led to the dearth of proper investigation, inspectors, and investigative journalism. The whole charade is a mob action, yet, it has been variously written that the operation of the law is to rid jungle justice, mob justice, and trial by ordeal. But in reality, it is commonplace than restraint.</p>
                <p>The point being made is that these issues led to the hydra-headed challenges, problems, and vices associated with administering criminal justice and which it is hoped that the ACJL is timely, if not late on arrival, to remedy the system from self-destruction. Issues like delays in the dispensation of criminal cases, unnecessary adjournments, congestions both of cases in courts and in prisons. Others are improper management and inefficiency in ensuring proper administration of criminal justice in the country. For identified and discussed is the idea of arrest before investigation, which in the proper manner investigation where supposed to begin and conclude before arrests are made. This way, the law enforcement will ensure informed prosecution, responsibility, and duty. However, this unusually is not the case as persons alleged of criminal conducts are seen as weird and dumped and left to gaunt in detention without further investigation. The court looked the other way and the law enforcement officer is never reprimanded, caution, or punished. He is instead a colossus, praised and admired as he continues in his sordid deeds.</p>
                <p>The reasons of police behaviors in this manner are legions suffice to mention a few which include (i.) any person he alleged of crime, (ii.) any person whom he knows is designing to commit an offense, (iii.) presence of reasonable suspicion. These alone do not hold water because that same law stipulates that: in the exercise of his power under this section, a police officer must show that there were flaws from which it could be reasonably inferred that the suspect committed that offense; the police action is not based on belief and the exercise of such power is objective. Thus, in Chukwuka v. COP it was observed that:</p>
                <p>"The test as to what is reasonable belief that a suspect has committed an offense is objective. It is not what the policeman himself considered reasonable but whether the flaws within the knowledge of the policeman at the time of the arrest disclosed circumstances from which it could be reasonably inferred that the appellant had committed an offense.</p>
                <p>However, the power of police is subject to the law and requires the police to show cause that there exists in flaw reasonable grounds for suspicion of guilt. The test must be, according to decided cases, that of a reasonable person lawing without passion or predisposition. It is principle on objectivity, and in the light of the flaws known at the time, not flaws that afterward may come to light.</p>
