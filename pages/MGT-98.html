            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focused on the recruitment and organization productivity, particularly on the recruitment sources, recruitment process, selection procedures, steps and techniques, interviews, and their influence on its effectiveness. The study findings showed that recruitment and selection system of NIPSS has had a significant influence on its effectiveness and productivity but unfortunately unconstructively because it doesn't systematically follow and observe the recruitment and selection procedures. Finally, a conclusion is drawn, and recommendations given are geared at improving the NIPSS recruitment and selection system into a more effective one.</p>
            
                <h3>Recruitment and Selection Processes at NIPSS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the study results, it was discovered that the majority of NIPSS staff fully understand recruitment and selection, as supported by the study results.</li>
                    <li>The study also revealed that NIPSS recruitment and selection process is not perfect because the right procedure and steps are rarely and not always followed.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Sources of Recruitment and Selection Process at NIPSS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similarly, the study unearthed that out of the two main sources of recruitment, the internal source is the most favored, and in most cases, such sources are less competitive and likely to yield less competent candidates.</li>
                    <li>It was again shown that NIPSS recruitment and selection processes are not subjected to the competitive process, which is effective and confirmed by the majority of the respondents in regard to sources.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Methods of Recruitment and Selection Used at NIPSS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The study results indicated that NIPSS selection methods and procedures don't engage in effective selection techniques, i.e., interviews, which are a critical element in a selection procedure leading to hiring less competent employees.</li>
                    <li>Finally, throughout the study, it was discovered that NIPSS recruitment and selection process is ineffective, and some staff are dissatisfied with it because it is marred by technical know-who rather than technical know-how. This, according to the study, has led to the ineffectiveness of NIPSS as a whole.</li>
                </ul>
