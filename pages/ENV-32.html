            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>            
                <p>Based on the results obtained from this research, the following research conclusions are drawn:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li> A total of 5 factors, out of these there most influential criteria for the measurement of project performance influenced by the selected procurement method were synthesized in the main survey, which were shown to be reliable. Data were collected from a representative sample of professional procurement staff and consultants' offices in Nigeria.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Project completion time</li>
                            <li>Project final cost</li>
                            <li>Project targeted quality</li>
                            <li>Project related risk</li>
                            <li>External environmental factor</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>Clients can truly benefit from realizing the importance of the above several factors into the selection of procurement method.</p>
            
                <p>The three most influential effects, as evaluated by procurement specialists and consultants, are: Project final cost, Project completion time, and project intended quality.</p>
            
                <p>It was concluded that both procurement specialists and consultants generally agree on the ranking order of the influence affecting the selected procurement method. This agreement confirms the influential effect of those factors on the selection of procurement system, which provides a level of validation for this research. According to the results of this study, it was concluded that there is no difference of the opinions between procurement specialists and consultants in the selection method affecting the performance of a project.</p>
            
                <p>The results give a general indication that both the conventional (traditional) and non-conventional procurement methods are currently embraced in Nigeria. This study reveals approximately two-thirds (58%) of construction projects are executed using variants of traditional procurement method; 28% are through variants of design and build method; 6.0% are executed through management procurement method.</p>
            
                <p>The procurement methods in use are still much of variants of traditional methods. Nigerian construction remains in the phase of almost exclusively using traditional methods specifically the lowest qualified bidder. This may be presumably due to the proclamation and directive set by the public procurement Agency, and this familiarity was found regarding to a long age existence of the PPA systems in the Nigerian construction industry. It could be noted that the percentages of the use of management procurement and PPPP methods are still significantly very low, indicating that the clients and their representatives are still not well familiar with this variant of non-conventional procurement system, or are yet to appreciate their advantages. The results of the study indicate that only 6% are familiar with management procurement method while 0% is familiar with PPP procurement method.</p>
            
                <p>The majority of respondents have indicated that current procurement methods (most prominently traditional) have directly contributed to projects overrunning in terms of cost and time, suggesting that this method is unsuitable for a modern, progressive construction industry in Nigeria. It is clear that more than half (58%) of the respondents would like to see a design and build procurement method used more. Only 28% of the respondents would like to see a traditional procurement method used more.</p>
            
                <p>This result supports that the respondents would like to deal with nontraditional procurement methods and apply new procurement methods rather than a traditional one in the future for construction projects in Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>Among the variant types of traditional procurement methods, measurement method based on the bill of quantities (Measure and pay method) had the highest selection share.</p>
