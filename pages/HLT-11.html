            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research centers on investigating the effects of child abuse on the social well-being of children. By this, it investigates the effects of child abuse on the social well-being of children in Gyel district of Jos South LGA of Plateau State. Child abuse is not a new phenomenon in the history of man. It has been going on right from time immemorial. In Africa/Nigerian society what constitute abuse today was never regarded as abuse in the past. It has been seen as a way of training the child to become a well-behaved, disciplined, and self-actualized person in society. It is a normal process that children from birth be exposed to a variety of experiences from parents, caregivers, and other adults in the society. This is to enable the children to acquire the necessary basic norms and skills for effective participation in the society where they belong and for their personal growth and development.</p>
            
                <p>The process of acquiring these skills is sometimes stressful for the children to bear. Some parents and caregivers make the condition for acquiring these skills so difficult that the children may find it difficult to cope. The condition in which children are exposed to as they try to acquire the skills to become disciplined and hardworking individuals is where the problems lie. When these conditions become over-stretched it becomes an abuse.</p>
            
                <p>Child abuse is a social problem that requires urgent attention because of the negative consequences and risks it poses on the Nigerian child. Educating the Nigerian Child is brightening the future of Nigeria in global competition, most especially with class consciousness in developed and developing countries.</p>
            
                <p>Furthermore, it is imperative to note that what constitutes child maltreatment in one society may not be considered the same in another society because of cultural variations, but empirical indicators give tangible evidence that can be tackled from their sources.</p>
            
                <p>From the data collected by the researcher, it can be seen that adequate measures should be taken to guard against child rape and incest, child maltreatment, child neglect, and early marriage. This is because it can foster insecurity and anarchy capable of decaying the society. This menace deters technological advancement and wastes of knowledge and talent untapped.</p>
            
                <p>The data collected also points out that more legislation on the issues regarding child abuse can put to rest this menace. This legislation may check and provide ways in which cultural practices can be adjusted to liberate the child from this ugly situation.</p>
            
                <p>However, to attain the overall objective of this research, the work was divided into five chapters. The first chapter examined the background of the study, statement of the problem, the research question of the study, the objectives of the study, significance of the study, scope of the study, and definition of key terms.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter two reviewed related literature on Child Abuse and Social Wellbeing. Concept of Child Abuse, types of child Abuse, Forms of Child Abuse in Nigeria, Influence of Culture on Child Maltreatment and Abuse, Concept of Child Wellbeing, The Implications of Abuse on Child Social Wellbeing, The Impact of Child Abuse on the Society as well as theoretical framework were discussed in this chapter.</p>
            
                <p>The chapter three of this study deals with the methods and procedures of data collection, location and population of study, sampling technique and sampling size, and the technique of data analysis.</p>
            
                <p>The survey research method and the simple random sampling technique are the research design and sampling technique respectively employed for this study. Questionnaires were administered in the survey research design.</p>
            
                <p>The fourth chapter of this work was devoted to data analysis and interpretation of results. This was done through the use of primary data (obtained through the questionnaire). The technique of data analysis used is the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) where a simple percentage table was used to determine the degree of responses. Chapter five has the summary, conclusion, and recommendation of the research.</p>
