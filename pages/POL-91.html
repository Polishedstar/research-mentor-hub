            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the data analyzed in chapter four, the following findings were arrived at:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bureaucracy encourages high productivity in the civil service.</li>
                    <li>The Ministry of Finance in Jos provides good incentives for both superiors and subordinates.</li>
                    <li>Proper communication enhances high productivity in the Ministry of Finance.</li>
                    <li>Bureaucracy leads to efficient service delivery in the Ministry.</li>
                    <li>Delegation of responsibilities enhances employee performance in the Ministry of Works, Housing, and Transport in Jos, Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>Wage increase is the best way of providing incentives to civil servants.</li>
                    <li>Adherence to rules and regulations improves performance in an organization.</li>
                    <li>Chain of command leads to greater efficiency in the civil service.</li>
                    <li>The performance of staff of the Plateau State Ministry of Finance before the implementation of the new minimum wage was good.</li>
                    <li>Bureaucracy has improved the relationship between staff of the Plateau State Ministry of Finance greatly.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is obvious that the minimum wage increase of the Nigerian civil servant is to enable them to perform effectively and efficiently. The policies regulating wage increases should create a conducive environment for the civil servant to operate.</p>
                <p>For any employer to enjoy maximum output from their employees, they should be able to pay a good wage or abide by the statutory provisions of the minimum wage for Nigerian civil servants and the organized private sector.</p>
                <p>The research findings have been able to establish a relationship between the new minimum wage and the Nigerian economy, as shown by the results of this research.</p>
