            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Accounting information plays a major role in preventing fraud in the banking sector, although fraud is inevitable as far as the notion is concerned. Several measures can be employed to curtail the level of fraud, including:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Obtaining references for new account instances: Some bank staff open accounts with the aim of using them to commit fraud. This can be mitigated by scrutinizing potential customers before opening their accounts and introducing references and status reports.</li>
                    <li>Establishing reconciliation departments in bank branches to reconcile all differences in accounting entries as soon as they occur.</li>
                    <li>Regular balancing of the books of account on a daily basis. Any accounts that refuse to balance should be addressed immediately.</li>
                    <li>Thorough assessment and examination of the past records of staff to be employed.</li>
                    <li>Verification of any large withdrawal before payment. Customers seeking to withdraw a substantial sum of money should be properly checked before payment is made.</li>
                    <li>Effective control of security items and the strong room, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to the bank's assets.</li>
                    <li>Internal auditing: The bank should establish an internal auditing function as an independent appraisal to assess the internal control system and assist the management and the Board in the effective discharge of their responsibilities. Internal audits provide analysis, appraisal, memoranda, counsel, and information about related activities.</li>
                    <li>External auditing: External auditing is conducted by independent professional accountants who are regulated by statute and have integrity. Their main function is to examine the accounts and financial statements of registered companies, such as banks.</li>
