            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The focus of this research has been to examine the role of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) in the formulation processes of the Nigerian foreign policy, from the year 1970 to 2012. Divided into five chapters, the study adopted the historical, descriptive and analytical methodology while looking into the historical background and transitions in the NIIA; its aims; functions; structure; funding; membership, as well as collaboration engagements with sister institutions.</p>
                
                <p>The study also examined Nigeria’s foreign policy between 1970 to 2012, while highlighting the NIIA’s various roles within the process, basically grouped under: research, personnel and technical roles. In addition, the NIIA’s various achievements and observed challenges were identified. Overall, the study takes a stand that despite varying hitches and need for improvement, the institute has recorded remarkable success and strides, in line with founding father aspirations, thereby justifying its existence. The study equally maintains that expectations on the institute piles up, even in the future, considering the Nigeria’s goals of development, in addition to the increasing rate of globalization and competitiveness among states within this century; making intellectual innovation and ideas a pre-requisite for the leadership class and policy makers in Nigeria, especially with regards to foreign policy formulation.</p>
