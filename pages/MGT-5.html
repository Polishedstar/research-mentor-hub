                <p>
                    Marketing concept is of critical social importance because it has been given the task of delivering the standard of living demanded by the people. The consumer has a multitude of needs and desires that they want to satisfy, and in our economy, the task of satisfying them has been delegated to marketing. If it fails to perform according to the dictates of society, the society will find some other means of satisfying its desires.

                <h3>IMPORTANCE TO THE FIRM</h3>
                <p>
                    The function that the marketing concept performs is the provision of a channel of communication between the business organization and society. A proper and efficient marketing department continuously feeds management and the production department with information concerning society's demand for products and services. Without this intelligence, no business could exist for long.
