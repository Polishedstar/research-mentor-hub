            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study assessed the impact of Government Agencies on the growth and development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Plateau State with particular reference to Industry Training Fund (ITF) Jos. The following key findings were made:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It was discovered that training/programming is one of the instruments that can be used to improve the growth and development of SMEs in Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>Government played a very significant role in improving the standards of SMEs.</li>
                    <li>SMEs have contributed immensely to improving the standard of living in Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>SMEs have played a substantial role in developing the economy of Nigeria and serve as a viable tool for reducing unemployment in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Government policies have a significant impact on SMEs in Plateau State.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The growth and development of SMEs in Plateau State is a step in the right direction. However, the determination of the success of SMEs without the input and aid from the Government Agencies has generated many setbacks for SMEs. ITF has a significant impact on SMEs in Nigeria. SMEs have brought about some level of satisfaction in the private sector by means of self-reliance.</p>
