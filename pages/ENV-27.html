            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <h3>RESEARCH QUESTION 1</h3>
                <p>How adequate, affordable, and accessible are the portable water and waste disposal services provided for the slum dwellers?</p>
            
                <p>The residents of the community who responded to the questionnaire indicated that the source of water is easily accessible in almost all seasons, although during the shortage of water, water from the source is inadequate, and the cost of water from water vendors is relatively high. Every solid waste management program needs funding. Unfortunately, especially in the era of tightening budgets, it is very difficult to find the needed human and material resources. Shortage of waste receptacles is another significant reason identified by the residents for indiscriminate waste dump. Waste receptacles should be easily accessible to the people; there are many areas in the community without waste receptacles. Drainages have been completely blocked with refuse. Sometimes waste receptacles are not emptied for days, even though they have been filled with wastes. As a result, people dump their refuse on the ground or in the gutter.</p>
            
                <h3>RESEARCH QUESTION 2</h3>
                <p>Are the residents of Oworonshoki aware of the implications of indiscriminate waste disposal?</p>
            
                <p>The number of respondents indicating that they are aware of the effects of solid waste in their environment is a clear indication of such problems. They accepted that solid waste is a breeding ground for disease vectors; they also agreed that many diseases can be prevented if waste is properly administered and managed. They are aware that many diseases can be prevented if solid wastes are properly treated. They agreed that polluted air from refuse dumping sites brings out odor and respiratory diseases. That the source of water can be contaminated by seepage from refuse dump sites, they agree that both underground and surface water can be polluted from refuse dump.</p>
