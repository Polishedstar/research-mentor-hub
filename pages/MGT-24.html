            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the light of the analysis of data, it was discovered that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The stages in designing an IMC strategy are informal, not following any specific order; in addition improvised meetings are often constituted as well as having informal meetings in the beginning of planning a communication strategy.</li>
                    <li>The findings show that the choice of communication channels is mainly influenced by personal contact. In addition, it was discovered that the personal channels are implemented more than the non-personal ones.</li>
                    <li>It was also discovered that no clear measurable objectives are stated when developing a communication strategy, except for one, which is to have all accommodations rented out. However, overall objectives exist, which is to create and maintain awareness to all target groups as well as creating interest, desire, and action. There is also effort to create media interest, in order to gain publicity and even greater interest.</li>
                    <li>Discoveries of the potential of the internet as a means to reach customers all over the world have substituted much of traditional advertisement. However, there is a lack of a way to implement e-commerce for customers to reserve and close sales. In addition, the groups as potential image builders have not been considered.</li>
                    <li>It was found that communication tools that are often unconsidered and unplanned are, to a great extent, implemented or considered. Specifically, design is a main tool to communicate the message and receive a lot of free publicity through media and events and exhibitions. The awareness and coordination of the different sources of the message strengthen the brand image and keep it consistent.</li>
