            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>All three parties are of the opinion that the cost of materials is the most important factor affecting the cost of construction in Nigeria. This is in line with the findings of Abdulaziz and Al-Juwairah (2002) about the factors contributing to construction costs in Saudi Arabia.</p>
            
                <p>Consultants rank the wrong method of estimation second. This is anticipated since they are more aware of different methods, accuracy, and precision of estimating. The same factor was ranked fourth by contractors. However, it was not in the top five factors in the client rankings.</p>
            
                <p>Consultants rank incorrect planning as the third most important factor affecting construction costs in Nigeria. It was, however, ranked second by both Contractors and Clients. These findings are also similar to those of Abdulaziz and Al-Juwairah (2002) about the factors contributing to construction costs in Saudi Arabia.</p>
            
                <p>Clients believe that the fluctuation of material prices also has a very significant effect on the cost of construction. They rank it as the fifth most important factor. Omoregie and Radfort (2005) came to the same conclusion after they studied the factors responsible for project delays and construction cost escalation in Nigeria. Although their survey revealed price fluctuation as the most severe cause of project cost escalation, which they attributed to the limitation in the exchange rate, which, in turn, affects construction material prices and the general price level.</p>
            
                <p>Contractors are of the opinion that poor contract management will affect the cost of construction. Kangari (1989) calls it management incompetence. Contractors rank it as the third most important factor.</p>
            
                <p>Since contractors depend on their Quantity Surveyors for reliable estimates, they can be severely affected by any wrong method of estimation. They rank it as the fourth most important factor.</p>
            
                <p>The three parties do not generally agree on the ranking order of factors affecting construction costs. There is a higher agreement between contractors and consultants than between the others. This supports the findings of Abdulaziz and Al-Juwairah (2002).</p>
            
                <p>The most effective method of minimizing the cost of construction in Nigeria, as perceived by the three parties, is ensuring efficient time management through proper resource planning, duration estimation, and schedule development and control. This is similar to the recommendations of Ashworth (2000) where he observed that profitable firms may be generating their revenues from the elimination of waste at both professional and trade practice levels. He recommended cost reduction measures, including: establishing firmly the requirements and features of the project at the onset before getting started, preparing the project team to do its best by getting members to sign off on capabilities and responsibilities, staying diligent about keeping the project on the right path through contract clauses that disallow significant changes once the project is underway, effective human resource management through effective motivation, and project tracking involving discerning early what area or paths are leading to dead ends and applying early corrective actions.</p>
