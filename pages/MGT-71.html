            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study revealed a significant relationship exists between Petroleum Profit Tax and Gross Domestic Product Growth measuring economic development. However, the positive relationship between petroleum profit tax and GDPG is not that significant compared to other variables under study. This is as a result of OPEC production/sales quota as well as continuous drop in crude oil prices at the international market over a decade now which is impacting negatively on the profits subject to tax of the oil companies operating in Nigeria. There is also a significant relationship between Company Income Tax and GDPG. Similarly, there is a significant relationship between Value Added Tax and GDPG. This significant result can be attributed to enhanced efficiency in VAT revenue collection, administration, advocacy and the recent broadening of tax base for VAT collection. The ratio of tax revenue to GDPG is still very low compared to other economies as Nigeria depends largely on crude oil export. Although taxation remains a strong socio-political and economic tool for economic development, Nigeria's experience is adverse due to tax leakages arising from tax evasion, avoidance, and low tax base. This study found that tax leakages are of global concern but the Nigerian experience is cancerous due to corruption in the system. The study collaborated other studies that believe what triggers the noncompliance to a large extent is expedited by the lack of transparency and good governance on the part of the state, which highly discourages tax/potential tax payers from complying willingly with their tax obligations.</p>
                <p>Premise on the discoveries of this study, it is therefore concluded that tax revenue affects significantly economic growth in Nigeria. Petroleum profit tax has a significant impact on economic growth, corporation taxes have an increased significant influence on economic growth, and value-added tax also exerts a significant impact on economic growth both in the long and short run. Therefore, the government should make efficacious the tax system of the country so as to curb practices that hampers the effectiveness of the system to generate the required revenue to cause a change in the growth of the economy. Also, the government should modify the institutional arrangement so as to aid a model for best practices of industries in the country, so as to ensure an increased industrial output in the country at the barest cost.</p>
