            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was carried out to determine the contribution made by small and medium-scale enterprises towards the industrial development of the Nigerian Economy.</p>
                <p>Data for the study were collected from the primary source, which was obtained from the questionnaires administered for the study. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the data of the study, and chi-square was also used for the study.</p>
                <p>The outcome of the study revealed that small and medium-scale enterprises contribute immensely towards the industrial development of the Nigerian industrial sectors. However, these enterprises face some challenges that hinder their operations, expansion, as well as their contribution to the growth of the Nigerian economy.</p>
                <p>Among the major challenges that hinder the development of SMEs are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Capital shortages</li>
                    <li>Lack of appropriate education and managerial skills on the part of the entrepreneurs</li>
                    <li>Poor monitoring, control, and accountability in the sector</li>
                    <li>Poor state of infrastructure in the economy</li>
                    <li>Low demand for products made in Nigeria</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like other developing countries, Nigeria has initiated a number of sector reforms on small and medium-scale enterprises with the aim of transforming the Nigerian economy from its present poor state to a highly industrialized state, as achieved by some Asian countries in the second half of the last century.</p>
                <p>In order to support micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises, the Nigerian government launched the microfinance scheme to provide financial services to the poor who are not served by conventional financial institutions.</p>
                <p>Presently, the Nigerian economy appears to be too harsh for the survival of most SMEs. For example, from the inception of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, to the present time, many small and medium-scale enterprises have folded. These have posed a global threat to the survival and growth of SMEs in the country and have put them at such a risk that one cannot just look at the availability of the resources in the economy and believe that there is a bright future for SMEs' growth and development.</p>
