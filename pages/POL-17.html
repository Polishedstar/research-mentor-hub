            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It is expedient at this point of the study to give a summary of the findings, which are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a form of relationship between Development Administration and Rural Transformation with about 80% positive and negative correlation with the socio-economic and political development of Barkin Ladi Government Area. This is in terms of having both an exploitative and developmental effect on the rural economy.</li>
                    <li>Development Administration does not contribute effectively to the overall transformation of rural communities in Plateau state. Even with its intended objectives of bringing government facilities, resources, and services to the doorsteps of the Nigerian teeming population in the rural areas, it still has a negative effect of over 70%, which has militated against the development of many rural communities.</li>
                    <li>The policies and programs or projects are usually formulated and implemented by both government and the local representatives or people to help remedy the problems affecting their development. This is in terms of provision of agricultural inputs, social and welfare services, infrastructural development, poverty eradication schemes, economic development, etc.</li>
                    <li>Most rural communities in Plateau State (i.e., Barkin Ladi LGA) are characterized by poor infrastructural development and inadequate social and welfare service delivery, poor rural economic base, devastating poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, high infant mortality rate, exploitation of the rural populace, as well as poor agricultural and industrial development and technological advancement.</li>
                    <li>Over 90% of the problems affecting rural communities are caused by several factors like inadequate human, material, and financial resources, insufficient effective administrative institutions or field units to administer development, lack of public accountability among officials (i.e., misappropriation and mismanagement of resources), and unequal distribution or redistribution of development projects and services in the local government area.</li>
                    <li>Effective and sustainable rural transformation in Plateau State can be realized through adequate provision and utilization of development resources, availability of effective and efficient administrative institutions/field units, proper audit reports and accountability to reduce corruption practices, and equitable distribution of project resources and services to the entire rural communities.</li>
