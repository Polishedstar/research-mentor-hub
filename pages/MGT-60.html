            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Looking at the analysis of the data collected from the field, it shows that 60% of respondents in question 2 inferred that packaging is very important in protecting products from damage and facilitating transportation. It also serves other functions, such as communicating with the target market. Most customers, both educated and illiterate, can identify a product with ease through its packaging. These functions help organizations increase their sales volume, as shown in question A, table 4 of the organization's questionnaire.</p>
                <p>Despite the importance of packaging to both customers and organizations, the research shows that packaging can be a nuisance to society. This is evident in question (table 6) of the customer's questionnaire, where 23 respondents strongly agreed that packaging has an effect on the environment due to the way it litters our surroundings, often leading to environmental pollution.</p>
                <p>The researcher also gathered responses on whether packaging should be discouraged or not. Most respondents said that packaging should not be discouraged because of its importance, as outlined above. Thus, 75% of respondents in table 5 of the customer's survey said that instead of avoiding packaging, organizations should use packages that can be easily destroyed, educate customers on the importance of disposing of packaging responsibly, and avoid using deceptive packaging.</p>
                <p>This research paper investigated social responsibility issues in the packaging of consumer products with a special reference to Nasco Pack Nigeria Ltd. The results of the study revealed that packaging has a significant effect on the sales volume of an organization and, at the same time, has a negative impact on our environment.</p>
                <p>The study found that packaging is an effective communication tool that conveys messages about products to consumers, facilitates product transport, and prevents damage. On the other hand, packaging contributes to environmental litter, often creating health hazards. Our streets are cluttered with packaging from products like biscuits, toilet soap, etc., which can take years to decay, leading to solid waste disposal problems.</p>
                <p>It is worth mentioning that some packaging can be deceptive, as a small quantity of goods may be packaged in a large container to make the product appear larger on the surface. This can cause customers to spend a significant amount of money on a small quantity of the product.</p>
                <p>Despite these issues, packaging should not be banned considering its importance to both customers and organizations. Marketers must take into consideration these social responsibility issues when packaging their products.</p>
