            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study examined the challenges of the Office Technology and Management Program as a remedy for entrepreneurship development among students. The findings indicate that the curriculum presents several challenges that teachers and students will face in order to achieve the program's aims and objectives. This aligns with the view that many training facilities, which are required to acquire the professional skills specified in the curriculum, rely on electricity. The erratic power supply situation in the nation poses a significant challenge to the effective implementation of an ICT-based Office Technology and Management curriculum.</p>
            
                <p>As pointed out by Adeola, in many Nigerian institutions, classroom accommodations are grossly inadequate, and many of these institutions have poorly equipped lecture rooms. Implementing the curriculum in Nigeria faces challenges related to insufficient funding and the lack of attention and sponsorship by the government. Additionally, certain facilities that are essential for teaching skills in Office Technology and Management are lacking, which hampers the acquisition of these skills. The state of technological equipment in institutions is a matter of concern.</p>
            
                <p>Office Technology and Management is indeed an innovative educational program that responds to the new demands of the business world and the world of work. The study's findings reveal various challenges in implementing the Office Technology and Management curriculum, including inadequacies in the supply of ICT equipment and facilities, unstable teaching staff, and inadequate funding. However, these challenges can be overcome by adopting strategies such as providing adequate training facilities and equipment and ensuring consistency in government policy. The Office Technology and Management program could be further enhanced by including other relevant courses that not only make graduates marketable but also self-reliant.</p>
