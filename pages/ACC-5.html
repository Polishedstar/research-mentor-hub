            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research conducted has involved and given insight into banking consolidation. From the study undertaken, it shows that the majority of the banking public appreciates the banking consolidation because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no delay in cheque processing.</li>
                    <li>There is an increase in loan facilities, with more of the banking public having access to loans than ever.</li>
                    <li>Bank consolidation has brought a positive change in the economy, as banks can now finance large micro-economic programs that can improve the country's economic position.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since the inception of consolidation, the findings indicate that the banking industry has changed its business concepts to meet global banking challenges. Banks no longer rely solely on the public, corporate organizations, and equity ventures to source funds. The study also reveals that staff enjoy a suitable level of job security, while those who are not qualified may lose their jobs.</p>
                <p>The findings also reveal that banks are facing positive challenges as a result of consolidation, encouraging them to invent new financial products and strategies to withstand competition with other banks. Moreover, the study shows that due to mergers and acquisitions, banks at the early stages experienced problems sorting out customer accounts from the acquired banks. Insider abuse in the banks has reduced, though not eradicated, and banks have opened several branches as required by the apex bank.</p>
