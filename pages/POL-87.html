            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focuses on people as assets for the socio-economic development of Jos North Local Government Council, with a case study of Jos North Local Government Area. It commences with a background and analysis of the significance to the general public in seeing that people are mobilized as assets for the socio-economic development of the nation through the review of relevant literature and administration of questionnaires to the selected respondents. Several findings were made as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One of the findings indicates that people, as a product of population, contributed to the socio-economic development of the nation positively in terms of competency, efficiency, and improved performance. This is because all institutions and social groups see people as indispensable assets for shaping or molding economic transformation of their societies.</li>
                    <li>The finding reveals that people's knowledge, attitudes, innovation, and their performance, such as hard work, loyalty, obedience, adequate representation of their organization with skills and care, attributed to the socio-economic development of Jos North Local Government Council.</li>
                    <li>However, in the study, respondents identified some of the problems and prospects of the population for the socio-economic development of Jos North Local Government Council, including inadequate funds, political instability, economic recession, and instability in the economy, resource constraints, as well as insufficient and unreliable data.</li>
                    <li>Moreover, the prospects include eradicating poverty and hunger, achieving universal basic education, achieving gender equality in primary and secondary school enrollment, reducing child mortality rate by two-thirds, improving maternal health by reducing the three-quarters the proportion of women dying during childbirth, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases by halting and reversing the incidence of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and developing a global partnership for development.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is obvious that people have become indispensable assets for the socio-economic development of their societies in the new millennium. Also, it is significant to the general public in seeing that people are mobilized as assets for the socio-economic development of the Local Government Council.</p>
                <p>However, this work provides a way towards the mobilization of both human and material resources through the provision of information on how to enhance the involvement of members of the public and their local government for socio-economic development purposes in Jos North Local Government Council. Whenever problems are identified and resolved properly, people have confidence and put in their best in their performance because they are aware that their problems are given adequate attention.</p>
