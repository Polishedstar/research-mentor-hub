            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The main aim of this project is to examine the roles that local government play in nation building. It was discovered that local government enhances national development, which creates job opportunities, provides services, and promotes political development from the grassroots levels. This often results in political, social, and economic development of the country at large.</p>
                <p>The local government faces a lot of obstacles or problems that hinder their contributions to nation building. This includes lack of adequate funding, poor manpower training, and corruption. The role of local government in nation building should be considered a necessity because the third tier must properly plan and find ways of implementing national development.</p>
                <p>Local government, as the third tier of government, has played fundamental roles towards nation building. The federal government depends on local government to experiment national development and to mobilize resources for development. Apart from providing social services to the rural populace, it serves as an opinion to the democratic setup.</p>
