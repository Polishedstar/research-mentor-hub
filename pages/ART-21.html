            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The major purpose of this study was to find out if social media has any impact on students as an information sharing tool among students of the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Sokoto, Sokoto State.</p>
            
                <p>Though the central theme of Chapter One has given the background to the study that depicts the importance of social media as well as its positive and negative impacts.</p>
            
                <p>Questionnaires were administered to get information from students of the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Sokoto, Sokoto State, to find out if there is any relationship between social media and information sharing among students.</p>
            
                <p>One hundred copies of questionnaires were administered, completed, and returned without two missing, indicating a 98% return rate.</p>
            
                <p>The responses from the respondents' percentages were organized and analyzed using a simple mean percentage. The result shows that social media has an effect on students' academic performance if used positively.</p>
            
                <p>Finally, there is a relationship between social media and information sharing among students of the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Sokoto, Sokoto State.</p>
            
                <p>In this chapter, an attempt has been made to draw the conclusion on the basis of analysis of the collected data made in the preceding chapters. The idea of the research problem reflected an attempt to examine the impact of social media as an information sharing tool among students of the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Sokoto, Sokoto State.</p>
