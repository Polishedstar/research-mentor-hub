            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work was carried out to assess the effect of leadership roles in a developing economy. The objectives of the study were to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Examine if leadership roles have been able to promote socio-economic development.</li>
                    <li>Ascertain if leadership roles have brought about improvement in the living conditions of the inhabitants of Plateau state.</li>
                    <li>Determine if leadership roles have improved the human development index of the people of Plateau state.</li>
                    <li>Determine the challenges of leadership roles in Plateau state.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the course of this research work, these findings were made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Leadership is the process of influencing group activities towards goal setting and goal achievement. When there are poor leaders, there will definitely be poor development. Good leadership and governance enhance development, and development is dependent on good leadership.</li>
                    <li>Leaders should be accountable for their actions, projects, policies, and programs should be equally distributed, and leaders need training to be effective. Good leadership impairs development.</li>
                    <li>Jos South LGA and Nigeria at large has lost traction in its quest for development. Political leaders are self-seeking and not oriented in the interest of the people. Therefore, every organization, whether public or private, large or small, should endeavor to consider these opinions to attain development through good leadership.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Conclusively, this research work has extensively discussed the effects of leadership roles in a developing economy. The research work conceives leadership as the process of influencing group activities towards goal setting and goal achievement. Hence, when there is a poor leader, there will be poor development. Bad leadership and governance cannot enhance development. It is therefore imperative for Nigerian leaders to focus on the general good of all than personal interest and ethnic interest to avert a looming doom which may extremely result in a bloody revolution and elimination of the entire political/leadership class in the country as was the case with Nigeria.</p>
                <p>A good leadership in government affairs is justified on how effective national resources have been utilized to forge or speed development. Nigeria is so much tainted with an image of bad leadership which speaks volumes to national development and unity. Effective leadership through good governance is the only known panacea to solve the problem of poverty, lack of employment opportunity, low-quality education, inequality, inadequate and non-functional infrastructures, high maternal death, low levels of human capital, high propensity to engage in crime, insecurity, etc. It helps to foster the prosperity of the people.</p>
