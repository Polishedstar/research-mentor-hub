            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Workers' participation is a feature in all organizations, whether small, medium, or large, but the procedures, methods, and levels of participation used by different organizations often differ significantly. The objective of the study was to assess the impact of workers' participation on the productivity of First Bank Plc, Jos Branch.</p>
                <p>In the course of the study, the following findings were made:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The extent of workers' participation in decision making at the company is inadequate.</li>
                    <li>Staff rank, educational qualification, and experience are determining factors for worker participation in decision making.</li>
                    <li>Workers do not always meet to discuss with managers; such meetings occur occasionally.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The study aimed to assess the impact of workers' participation in decision making on organizational productivity. From the findings, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Workers' participation serves as a training and testing ground for future members of upper management.</li>
                    <li>Lack of qualified and company-oriented individuals undermines workers' participation in decision making at lower organizational levels.</li>
                    <li>The availability of skilled individuals in organizational decision making promotes productivity.</li>
                    <li>Management is encouraged to involve workers in decision-making processes and change their decisions when rejected by workers, as this may hinder organizational objectives.</li>
                    <li>The extent of subordinates' participation in decision making is inadequate, and management should improve it to enhance productivity.</li>
                    <li>Frequent meetings between management and workers can help widen workers' knowledge and increase their understanding of decision making and their job.</li>
                    <li>Qualifications, rank, and experience on the job are key criteria for worker participation; therefore, management should invest in training and development to align with these criteria.</li>
                </ul>
