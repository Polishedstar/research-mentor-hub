            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>It was discovered that the organization does human resource planning in order to achieve organizational goal attainment.</li>
                    <li>It has also been found that the organization performs human resources planning every year.</li>
                    <li>It has also been discovered that the executives are usually responsible for planning human resources for the organization.</li>
                    <li>It was found that the recruitment of manpower meets the demand of the organization.</li>
                    <li>It was also found out that the organization uses short-term manpower planning.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that the organization trains its staff.</li>
                    <li>It has been discovered that the organization trains its staff every three (3) years.</li>
                    <li>From the findings, it was discovered that the organization organizes on-the-job training for their staff.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that training and development enhance productivity and efficiency.</li>
                    <li>That the effort of understaffing in an organization will lead to low productivity in the organization.</li>
                    <li>It has been discovered that the organization motivates its employees.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the research findings, it can be reasonably concluded that human resources planning increases employees' performance, enhances organizational productivity and efficiency. By treating human resources as an important asset and continuously strengthening human resources, the utilization of human resources planning aids in achieving organizational goals and objectives.</p>
