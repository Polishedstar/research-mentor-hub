            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the discussions above, it is crystal clear that under Nigeria law, basically two types of marriages, the statutory and customary law marriage. While the former is monogamous in nature, the latter is polygamous. Everyone, of full capacity, is at liberty to contract any of these marriages. Both marriages, when contracted, the parties do so with an intention of permanence subject to death or divorce. For a statutory marriage, only a formal dissolution by a competent court of law can bring it to an end. However, a customary law marriage can be brought to an end through judicial and non-judicial means. Whatever means adopted, particularly the non-judicial, the refund of the bride price is an indispensable requirement notwithstanding the length of time of living apart of the couple.</p>
                <p>The decision in the case reviewed above is watershed and has seriously impacted, in diverse ways, the matrimonial and inheritance jurisprudence of Nigeria. The decision has established the position that while a marriage is a contract and contracts can be terminated constructively, marriage is not amenable to this. Whoever wishes to bring a customary marriage to an end must, as a matter of legal necessity, comply with the applicable customary practices. In addition to this, unless and until a deceased person, in the absence of making a will, expropriates in favor of an intended beneficiary, the beneficiary cannot lay claim of exclusive entitlement to his/her deceased spouse's estate.</p>
                <p>Given the matters arising above, it is recommended that enlightenment on the need for people to make wills to avoid undesirable consequences, whereby persons other than those they would have wanted to inherit their properties inherit them. There is a serious misconception that once one writes a will, it is tantamount to an invitation to death. Erroneous beliefs, such as this, must be corrected through enlightenment.</p>
