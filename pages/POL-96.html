            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
            <!DOCTYPE html>
                <p>The study highlights conflict resolution and organizational performance in Jos South Local Government Council. Findings here show that several bodies such as Government, civil society organizations, Non-governmental organizations, security agencies, and traditional leaders have played some role in addressing the organizational challenges and the conflicts as well. However, it shows that government has a larger role to play and should collaborate with other stakeholders locally and internationally to curb the menace.</p>
                <p>From the data presented and analyzed, the following findings were made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Conflict means a dispute that occurs when interests, goals, or values of different individuals or groups are incompatible with each other. Lack of resources, different expectations, competition, lack of cooperation, interdependence, and communication problems cause conflicts in Jos South LGC.</li>
                    <li>Conflicts tend to have negative consequences for both the individual and the local government. Conflict motivates individuals to do better and work harder in the local government.</li>
                    <li>Conflict resolution involves designing effective strategies to minimize the dysfunctions of conflict. For conflict to be managed, conflict elements, emotions, behavior, and contradictions must be identified.</li>
                    <li>Inefficiency in handling conflict affects organizational performance. The strategy(ies) used for conflict resolution is not effective. Efficient and effective conflict management contributes to the upliftment of Jos South LGC.</li>
                    <li>Conflict affects effective organizational communication and cordial relationships.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Conflicts are part of human nature and it is extremely important to study it not only for theoretical purposes but also for organizational practice. Conflict analysis and its resolution have an important role in private, public, and political organizations, as well as in judicial and work disputes, in military operations, and many other institutions.</p>
                <p>Studies indicate that causes of organizational conflicts in Nigerian organizations are lack of resources, salary and wages, struggle for power, and interpersonal problems. This leads to competition for the scarce resources. Therefore, it is pertinent for the organizations' management to ensure that the available limited resources are utilized optimally for the benefit of the organization and other stakeholders.</p>
                <p>Though conflict is often viewed as negative, it is capable of increasing organizational innovativeness and productivity, thereby improving organizational performance. In addition, conflicts build the spirit of teamwork and cooperation among the employees of an organization. The most used means of managing conflict among the managers in Nigeria are bargaining, collaboration, and avoidance.</p>
                <p>When conflicts are properly managed in organizations, it will lead to the development of the organization for effective attainment and achievement of organizational goals and objectives.</p>
