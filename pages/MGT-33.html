                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Hypothesis one, which states that there is no relationship between promotion and job satisfaction, was rejected. From the test of hypothesis, it was shown that there is a relationship between promotion and job satisfaction. This points to the fact that most enterprises use promotion to induce job satisfaction among their employees.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Hypothesis two, which states that a conducive environment does not contribute to job satisfaction, was not accepted. The test established that a conducive environment contributes to job satisfaction, indicating that managers should make their working environment conducive.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Hypothesis three, which states that there is no relationship between job satisfaction and employee morale, is rejected. The test established that job satisfaction increases employee morale.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Management doesn't understand the impact of an increase in salaries, as they don't see the need for an increase in salary.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The study also finds out that poor pay packages, lack of social recognition, and a conducive working environment are the factors that negatively affect job satisfaction.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>            
                <p>This study has attempted to examine the impact of job satisfaction on workers' productivity. After going through the whole process of data analysis, hypothesis testing, and summary, the following conclusions are hereby drawn: Most of the varied problems encountered have been invested in since most of these problems result from poor management of the government-owned enterprises. It is believed that with improved management, productivity will be increased.</p>
