            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
            <p>The research results revealed that farmers in the area believed that lack of financial capital to acquire inputs; market inaccessibility, poor infrastructure, climate change, and poor mechanization are amongst the main setbacks to agricultural transformation in the area. Also, farmers have devised some coping strategies in order to fight against the challenges they are facing. Some of the coping strategies worked but some of them were not effective.</p>
            
            <p>From some of their proposed solutions, it is clear that farmers are aware of the obstacles to agricultural development. Farmers have shown that they had mixed feelings about the contribution of NGOs and government to agricultural development in the area. Their opinions indicated that although the government and NGOs as major stakeholders established some successes, there is still a lot to be done if agricultural development is to be achieved in the area.</p>
