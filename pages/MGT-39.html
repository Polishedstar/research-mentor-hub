            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The following were revealed in the course of analyzing the hypothesis in the research work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It has been discovered that the staff of the Industrial Training Fund said that the organization consults their subordinates before they embark on decision making. Findings in this research indicate that the organization takes into consideration the opinions of their subordinates, as they are the principal actors in the organization.</li>
                    <li>It also revealed that the leadership style in their organization creates a conducive atmosphere for initiating decision making. The style of leadership adopted in an organization significantly impacts the atmosphere of the organization.</li>
                    <li>It has been discovered that a good leadership style has a positive impact on organizational productivity, as leadership serves as a role model for other employees to follow.</li>
                    <li>The findings reveal that an organization can hardly achieve its organizational productivity without a leadership style. Different leadership styles are needed for diverse groups of people.</li>
                    <li>It also discovered that the majority of people prefer to adopt a democratic style of leadership over other leadership styles.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Leadership style in relation to achieving organizational productivity is a key subject matter in an organization. The leadership style of an organization can influence organizational productivity both negatively and positively. Creating a conducive atmosphere and an air of belongingness for followers or employees can impact the organization's strengths and work on its weaknesses. Organizational productivity is closely related to the subordinates of an organization as they perform their individual functions.</p>
                <p>The leader directs their path in which they are expected to work. No single leadership style is perfect or the worst, but they vary as situations arise in the organization. Changes in the environment can affect the organization's objectives. A rigid leadership style is not advisable, as change is constant and inevitable.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, encouraging the integration of various leadership styles in organizations can help attain organizational productivity.</p>
