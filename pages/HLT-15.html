            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study was structured into five chapters. Chapter one looked into the background of the study identified. The problems of the study, objective of the study were clearly stated, research questions and hypothesis to guide the investigation were formulated. The chapter also highlighted the justification and significance of the study, the scope of the study were also stated. The study variables also defined terms relevant to the study were defined based on their contextual use in the work.</p>
                
                <p>The chapter two dealt with three basic components of the study. These are the conceptual framework which emphasized the historical background of Health Information Management, Communication, Database as Integral to healthcare, Software in Service Delivery care ICT, Medical Hardware, Purpose of Communication and other aspects relevant to Health Information Management, framework and summary of the review.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter three presented the methodology for the study. Essentially, the chapter discussed the design and population of the study. An appropriate sampling size was determined and selected using Taro Yamaneâ€™s formula and data analysis.</p>

                <p>In line with the above discussion, the research found out that a database provides better tools for monitoring and supervising data management in the hospital and it also helps in securing vital information about individual patients.</p>
                
                <p>Evidently, software can be used to examine the internal organs of the body. Literature also shows that software provided patients with clinical information and that it also contains the information that instructs the hardware to perform a task.</p>
                
                <p>Information Communication Technology has helped the Health Industry in disseminating vital information and strengthens the interaction between patients and healthcare providers. And it also provides the hospital with electronic medical records.</p>
                
                <p>Hardware is not left behind in providing Health Information Management in achieving service delivery care in terms of ensuring that patient information is secured and protected. It also provides the hospital with vital information that will ensure adequate treatment for these patients.</p>
