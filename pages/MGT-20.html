                    <li>
                        That skills acquisition promotes economic development in Plateau State, thereby bringing positive changes in the economy of the state with increasing technological progress, high capital savings, high rate of investment, efficiency in production, and innovations of techniques, high level of output, steady economic growth, and an increase in GDP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That NDE contributes/encourages skills acquisition in the state, meaning that NDE has a trail in the area of youth's empowerment and vocational skills development, job creation, sensitization, and re-orientation of graduates to take up self-employment instead of wage employment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That skills acquisition and innovation are at the peak of awareness in Plateau State and Nigeria at large; hence getting more attention from the government and the private sector.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, research reveals that inadequate power supply and lack of adequate infrastructural amenities are still serious challenges to entrepreneurs.
