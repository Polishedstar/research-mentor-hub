            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the research conducted, the findings can be summarized as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Through the training provided by the NDE, youth were able to become self-employed. This had a positive impact by:</li>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Increasing their income and diversifying their income base.</li>
                        <li>Strengthening their individual capacity to meet their needs and fostering a greater interest in their work to achieve self-reliance.</li>
                        <li>Maintaining a sense of belonging as they operate their own businesses, enabling them to make independent decisions and be answerable to nobody.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>The study also revealed that youth play a significant role in our society, both within and outside of it. Most of the respondents emphasized that without the youth, our country could face total collapse since they make up a significant portion of the labor force. In response to this challenge, the federal government initiated programs to ensure that a substantial number of youths are trained to adapt to the demands of modern society.</li>
