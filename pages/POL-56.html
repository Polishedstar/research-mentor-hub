            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Very many conflicts that have occurred in society today are a result of the struggle for either burgeoning economic opportunities in the form of mineral resources, political gains where one ethnic group or a coalition of ethnic groups seeks to project their political advantage, or even the struggle for cultural superiority when an ethnic group or a coalition of ethnic groups try to suppress other cultures or inculcate them into their own culture. The Jos North crises, which the researcher has chosen to review from 2001 to 2004, falls into these categories as mentioned above. The crises occurred at different phases, based and motivated by religious as well as political factors, and any attempt to reduce the crises to just one or any of these phases would be a violation of the living reality.</p>
                <p>One reason that informed the choice of the topic for research is the researcher's desire to analyze and evaluate the adverse effect of the crises on the economy of Jos North. Adverse in the sense that crises, no matter how little and cheap, bring no good to society and the parties involved in it.</p>
                <p>The researcher has brought to light the causes and origin of the 2001 to 2004 crises in Jos North through literature review and field research. In arriving at those reasons and objects identified as the origin and cause of the crises, the pattern and trends of migration of the various ethnic groups that have found themselves on the Jos plateau today were examined. This includes both the earlier ones that arrived to occupy the virgin land and the later ones that came to seek fortune, as well as what informed their ideas to lay claim to the ownership of Jos Township, examined in chapters one, two, and three, respectively. Also examined are the efforts the government and other concerned authorities made at addressing the crises.</p>
                <p>However, before the Jos North crises of 2001 to 2004 broke out, both the indigenous and immigrant populations had lived together, fraternized seriously in the exchange of ideas and culture. Upon the breakout of the crises, there was a fall-off of relations, particularly between the Hausa and Fulani and the indigenous ethnic groups. Such incongruous and lugubrious conflicts created disaffection and distrust among the polities of Jos North. The big one, however, was the devastation the crises caused to the economy of Jos North. This devastation has been anchored on the bases of destruction of lives and properties, economic, political, and social stagnation, change of settlement pattern, and distrust among the polities of Jos North at different levels. All these have been examined in chapter four. As Jos North local government area wallows through the mud toward the direction of recovery, caution must be taken to prevent any other tragic occurrence in the form of conflict. It is on this ground that some recommendations will be proposed to guide the relevant authorities in policy formulation.</p>
