            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings support the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis, indicating that the cashless policy has a positive effect on economic transaction options. This implies that the cashless policy is likely to enhance economic activities rather than hinder them. Cashless policies and electronic money represent sophisticated solutions to the challenges associated with cash usage. However, the successful implementation of this policy in Nigeria requires effective planning due to the existing socio-economic, political, and financial structures common in developing countries.</p>
                <p>Challenges such as poverty, inadequate infrastructure, the slow development of the banking sector, and the financial system pose threats to the policy's success that must be addressed.</p>
                <p>This study delved into the new cashless policy in Nigeria to determine its impact on the country's economy. The research was driven by the desire to address the discrepancy between financial sector reforms and improvements in the standard of living of Nigerians.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, this study emphasizes the crucial role of the Central Bank in shaping the future of the payment system. Over the next decade, the transition towards a cashless society in Nigeria and other nations is inevitable. Therefore, the Central Bank must proactively anticipate these changes and guide them to ensure the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the domestic cashless policy system.</p>
