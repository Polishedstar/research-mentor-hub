            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The aim of the study work is to investigate how design error can affect the Initial Cost of a project. The clients, consultants, and contractors were the subject of the study, and both their individual and collective responses were used for the analysis of the study. Also, respondents that carry out public and private projects were also used to determine the significant factors responsible for error in Nigerian construction projects. The findings of the study revealed the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Design error affects the Initial Cost of a construction project, resulting in cost overruns in both cost and time of a project. A lot of factors were found to be responsible for design errors in construction projects, including unclear scope of work or change in scope of work, time, inexperience of the designer, and inaccuracy of the design documents.
                    </li>
                    <p>The above statement concurred with the research of Davis and Ledbetters, in which it was determined that "accuracy of the design documents" was the most critical of the criteria used in the initial evaluation of design effectiveness. Also, with Chalabi, Beaudin, and Salazar (1987), which stated that "a poorly defined scope of work will create undesirable results, increase the Initial Cost and time of the project and cause dissension between the owner, designer, and contractor."</p>
                    <li>
                        Among the three categories, the clients, consultants (designer), and contractors, the consultants' factors are found to be more responsible for design errors in Nigerian construction projects, which ultimately increase the Initial Cost of a project.
                    </li>
                    <p>This statement also agreed with the research by Chalabi, Beaudin, and Salazar (1987). The contractor responding to the survey stated, "We can build whatever the designer gives us, in spite of the contract; it will only cost more."</p>
                    <li>
                        The findings of the study also revealed that the designer should be held responsible for the design error and pay for the correction if they created the error. This also concurred with the research studies of Davis and Ledbetter (1987), indicating overwhelmingly that the designer should be held responsible for the design error and pay for the correction. If the designer created the error through the production of the drawings and specifications, then they are responsible.
