            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Plateau state has shown its interest in the fight for the eradication of child abuses but it is yet to be totally committed to its international agreements to protect these and the continuous abuse of the rights of children. Every indicator used in appraising the laws shows that there has been minimal accomplishment since the enactment of the CRA. The implementation of the CRA is still in its infancy, and the possibility of it overriding other laws is still in doubt. It is one thing to make laws and another thing to ensure proper implementation, as laws are not made in a vacuum. These laws must be revisited, and where it is required to be reviewed, repealed, or amended, lawmakers should not hesitate to do so or politicize it.</p>
