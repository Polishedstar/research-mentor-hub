            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>As demonstrated in the previous chapter through the simple percentage method, based on the responses of the one hundred and twenty respondents involved in the study, the following findings were derived after administering questionnaires to students selected from four secondary schools in Kanke Local Government Area:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The culture of the people significantly affects child upbringing, which, in turn, impacts a child's performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>The problem of teenage parents and early marriage has a substantial impact on a child's performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Divorce and the separation of parents adversely affect a child's performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>The lack of proper family planning leading to child abuse has negative consequences for a child's performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Parents with alcohol-related issues often prioritize spending on drinking over their children's education.</li>
                    <li>Delays in salary payments force many parents to send their children into the streets for hawking, affecting students' performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Government educational plans and policy implementation play a role in a child's performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>The lack of qualified mathematics teachers affects students' performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Incidents of sexual harassment by teachers may lead to student dropouts from school and poor performance in mathematics.</li>
                    <li>The poverty rate in many families contributes to a child's poor performance in mathematics.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The researcher collected the results of 10 students from each school, out of which five (5) had been abused by parents or guardians in the second term of 2007/2008 mathematics results. Using the correlation coefficient to analyze the data, where "x" represents the performance of students who were not abused, and "y" represents the scores of students abused by parents or guardians, it was evident that there was a significant difference in the performance of these two sets of students. The raw data showed that those who were not abused generally performed better than those who were abused.</p>
