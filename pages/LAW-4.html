            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>During the course of this research work, the following results were generated, and it reveals the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The highest occurrence of accidents in Plateau state is found between April to October, signifying the rainy season in the state.</li>
                    <li>Most accidents have been observed to occur at night.</li>
                    <li>FRSC officials believe that public enlightenment programs take the lead in measures put in place to reduce accidents.</li>
                    <li>To ascertain the effectiveness of accident reduction measures, most FRSC workers believe in its effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Most of the drivers believe that FRSC performs all activities established for accident reduction.</li>
                    <li>FRSC officials desire salary increase and special allowances for better working conditions.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, FRSC workers testified that the level of compliance to traffic rules and regulations is fair.</li>
                    <li>A good number of drivers acknowledged that disobedience to traffic rules and regulations is a major cause of road traffic accidents.</li>
                    <li>FRSC faces challenges in accident reduction because they are few in number, they don't have the necessary facilities, they are more interested in generating revenue, and they don't work at odd times (periods prone to accident occurrences).</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>The overall goal of the Decade of Action for Road Safety, 2011 - 2020 is to stabilize and then reduce the forecast level of road traffic fatalities around the World by 2020 (WHO, 2011).</p>
                <p>Also, one of the facts discovered from FRSC's 'safe road in Nigeria,' an initiative to reduce road traffic accidents, is that accidents kill more than HIV/AIDS. Having this fact at hand is a major eye-opener to the level of damage and loss it has caused to the nation's economy.</p>
                <p>Even though FRSC's efforts are noticed nationwide and are seen to be effective in accident reduction, it has been discovered through this study that accidents occur mostly at nights and during the rainy season, enforcement equipment is inadequate, FRSC desires better working conditions and staff welfare, and accident reduction methods need to be improved upon.</p>
                <p>It is, therefore, pertinent to intensify efforts on improving these findings to ensure an accident-free environment with the utmost urgency. This research work will sensitize the general public on the roles of FRSC in accident reduction and also the roles of every stakeholder in alleviating the eventualities of accident occurrences.</p>
