            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial problems have been the major and most serious impediment to small-scale enterprises towards buttressing the growth and development of industries in Plateau State, particularly in Jos North.</li>
                    <li>Nigeria's policies and programs towards small-scale firms have always been efficient but not effective.</li>
                    <li>It is now a known fact that small-scale business is the bedrock of any meaningful economic growth and development, and human beings play that important role.</li>
                    <li>High levels of illiteracy by the existing entrepreneurs who are, in one way or another, not mentally balanced to carry out some business programs caused by educational impediment.</li>
                    <li>This report also found out that the inability to source for loans from banks which require collateral, poverty, and corruption hinders the growth and development of the economy.</li>
                    <li>This research also found out that small-scale businesses serve as a means for entrepreneurs and employees to be self-reliant. Therefore, every economy depends largely on the contribution of small-scale business.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This research has provided procedures necessary to start up a small-scale business. Also, the problems faced by SMEs are examined and highlighted, as a result of which solutions have been provided. These solutions are geared toward addressing the problems hindering the progress of small-scale business.</p>
                <p>Because of the major roles that small businesses have played in the development of the economy and also in alleviating poverty, the researcher recommends that there should be a provision of capitals through loans. It was also observed that NGOs and individuals need to encourage.</p>
                <p>The researcher, therefore, concludes by saying that small-scale business has contributed to the growth and development of the economy and has also helped in poverty alleviation.</p>
