            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The findings revealed that both teachers and students agree that parents consider training of the boy child more than training the girl child. The belief is that training the female student may not yield economic benefits for her, but her husband will benefit from her. In contrast, the boy child, seen as the family's namesake and breadwinner, should be properly trained.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The findings also show that both teachers and female students agree that parents' religious beliefs, especially among Muslim adherents, support early marriages. They believe that early marriage can protect the girl from unwanted pregnancies if she attends school. Forcing the girl child into early marriage based on religious beliefs can hinder her academic future. Most parents do not prioritize female students' participation in religious activities.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Both teachers and female students concur that wealthy parents provide learning materials for male children, while most homes are not conducive to learning. Additionally, parents do not employ lesson teachers to assist female students with their homework.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The findings reveal that parents' culture and tradition affect the academic performance of female students. Parents may view early marriage for female students as a way to protect them from unwanted pregnancies if they go to school or to preserve the family's name. Cultural beliefs also prioritize educating male children over female children. Female students may be married early because parents consider them a financial burden in terms of their education. Early marriage is seen as a way to protect girls' virginity and maintain cultural norms.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The findings also indicate that parents' educational status determines the academic performance of female students. Illiterate parents may not monitor or care about the academic performance of female students, potentially hindering their academic future. In contrast, educated parents actively support their female students by paying school fees on time, providing learning materials, creating a conducive learning environment at home, and employing lesson teachers to assist them. Educated parents have more faith in the potential, capabilities, and abilities of female students than illiterate parents. Illiterate parents may prioritize cultural norms, such as early marriage, over sending girls to school, as they believe that attending school may affect the girls' virginity and lead to unwanted pregnancies. Late marriage, due to schooling, is often seen as dishonorable to the family.</p>
