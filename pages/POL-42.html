            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the analysis and interpretation of data in Chapter four (4), it is evident that the responses of respondents in Jos-South Local Government Area of Plateau State, Nigeria, resulted in the following major findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The relationship between community development and communal efforts.</li>
                    <li>Education as a tool for community development.</li>
                    <li>Local government's contribution towards community development.</li>
                    <li>Impact of community leaders in rural communities.</li>
                    <li>Self-help approach as a means for community development.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In conclusion, community development serves as a tool for rural transformation in Jos-South Local Government Area of Plateau State. The efforts of local government towards the attainment of community development should be directed towards educating, contributing, and improving the living conditions of rural communities for their development, as they constitute the backbone of national building.</p>
