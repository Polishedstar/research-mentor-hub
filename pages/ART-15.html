            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study primarily focused on Lagos residents and their perception of the image of Nigerian journalists. Just like every other profession where the image of practitioners is considered sacrosanct, journalism is no exception. The researcher deemed it essential to seek people’s perception of the image of journalists, considering their role as societal watchdogs with status conferral responsibilities on others. The study aimed to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine the perception of Nigerian journalists’ image by Lagos residents.</li>
                    <li>Determine if Lagos residents’ perception of journalists’ image influences their rating of the credibility of news reports.</li>
                    <li>Identify the demographic factors that influence respondents’ perception of journalists’ image.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These objectives also formed the basis for the research questions outlined in Chapter One.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter Two provided a review of books, journals, theses, and other scholarly works to provide conceptual and empirical reviews. The study incorporated two theoretical frameworks: Source credibility and social construction of reality theories.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter Three employed a survey research methodology, and data collected were presented, analyzed, and discussed in Chapter Four. The findings included:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>89.9% of Lagos residents read or listen to news reports by Nigerian journalists.</li>
                    <li>33% of Lagos residents read or listen to news reports by Nigerian journalists on a daily basis.</li>
                    <li>52.5% of Lagos residents access news through the internet, primarily due to easy accessibility.</li>
                    <li>73.3% of Lagos residents rated the image of Nigerian journalists fairly.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Furthermore, the study concluded that Lagos residents place high importance on the image of journalists in relation to the credibility of their news reports. However, they do not give blanket acceptability to all news reports by journalists with a favorable image, nor do they reject all news reports from journalists with a negative image. The socio-demographic attributes of Lagos residents play a limited role in influencing their perception of the image of Nigerian journalists.</p>
                
                <p>In Chapter Five, the study provided a summary, conclusion, and recommendations.</p>
            
                <p>Based on the findings, it can be concluded that Lagos residents have a generally positive perception of the image of Nigerian journalists. However, they identified poor professional conduct as an area in which Nigerian journalists need improvement to boost their image perception. Lagos residents also emphasized the importance of journalists' image to the credibility of news reports but were selective in their acceptance of news reports based on the perceived image of the journalists. The study indicated that socio-demographic attributes of Lagos residents play a minor role in influencing their perception of the image of Nigerian journalists.</p>
