            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study emphasized the importance and the need for effective and efficient budgeting and budgetary systems in the public sector. It also recorded failures in implementing budgeting and budgetary control systems in public enterprises.</p>
                <p>Budgeting is concerned with a qualitative expression of a proposed future plan of action by the management for a set time, per R.U. Oka (2003).</p>
                <p>Any managerial decision about budgets that is not properly made can result in inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the organization (failure).</p>
                <p>Relevant literature was reviewed, and it was discovered that long-term survival depends on proper planning and control.</p>
                <p>Data were collected from the responses of seventy-five staff out of one hundred randomly selected public enterprises in Plateau State.</p>
                <p>To analyze the data collected, frequency distribution, mean percentage, tables, and scales were used. The effectiveness of the contribution of budgeting and budgetary control was determined using the Likert Scale, which revealed that budgeting and budgetary control systems are effective in public enterprises.</p>
                <p>The null hypothesis formulated for this research work was tested using the chi-square test, which led to the rejection of the hypothesis and the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis, which is that budgeting and budgetary control systems have contributed to a great extent to the effectiveness of public enterprises.</p>
                <p>Budget committees should be set up to ensure that budgets are implemented based on the approved budget and to ascertain that money spent is not more than what was approved in the budget.</p>
                <p>Different control measures should be put in place where there are deviations of actual performance from the standards, called variances. These variances should be grouped into favorable and unfavorable categories, and corrective measures should be put in place to control the variances.</p>
