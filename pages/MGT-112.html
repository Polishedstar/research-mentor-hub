            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study indicates that promotional strategies have played a very significant role in the company's product, especially using the three tools of promotion: advertising, sales promotion, and publicity. These strategies have been instrumental in creating awareness about the company's products and improving the company's image to outsiders.</p>
                <p>The methodology used in generating relevant data for this research work was primarily through questionnaires and personal interviews, as discussed in Chapter Three. It was discovered that advertising, sales promotion, and publicity were the major tools employed by the company to achieve their objectives. Sales promotion, in particular, is frequently used by Nasco Foods Company to stay competitive. Meanwhile, Chapter Four, which covers data analysis and interpretation, including statistical testing, showed that advertising and sales promotion have been effective for Nasco Foods Nigeria Limited, Jos.</p>
                <p>Based on the study, it is evident that promotional mix is an effective tool for marketing strategies, as established by Engel, Kinner, and Warshaw (1978). The analysis has demonstrated the effectiveness of promotion in the context of this study.</p>
                <p>The management of Nasco Foods Nigeria Limited should continue to strictly adhere to their promotional policies as they aim to reach new consumers and maintain their existing market. This study's findings may also be generalized to other organizations facing similar environmental factors or conditions. In conclusion, there is no doubt that promotional strategies have a significant impact on consumer patronage.</p>
