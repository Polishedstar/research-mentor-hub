            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Paramount the data collected through the questionnaire administered to various staff on the topic motivation and organizational performance in Jos North Local Government Council.</p>
                <p>The following are the summary of findings made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The researcher discovered that motivation is aimed at improving the performance of staff at work and also improving their personal lives, but the majority of the respondents representing the entire population of the study were not satisfied with the motivation policy in the organization. They are of the opinion that the motivation policy does not meet their needs and aspirations.</li>
                    <li>The researcher discovered that the complaints of the staff are not attended to. This means that there is a very poor level of communication between the staff and the management; this makes people believe that management policies are not geared or aimed at benefiting the subordinates.</li>
                    <li>It is also discovered that corruption is a hindrance to development in the local government.</li>
                    <li>The research also reveals that lack of supervision hinders development. This can lead to abandoned projects and underdevelopment in the organization.</li>
                    <li>In addition, the survey reveals that the wrong appointment of personnel in the job also hinders development in the organization. Staff who know how to do their work feel reluctant to work when they see others not working because they do not have the experience. This happens mostly in group assignments given to the staff.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The purpose of my research was to find out about motivation and organizational performance. I was able to carry out the research with the aid of questionnaires, and I discovered that motivation is the psychological feature that arouses an organism to action toward a desired goal and elicits control and sustains certain goal-directed behaviors, as stated in Chapter two.</p>
                <p>With the help of my findings, I discovered that motivation and organizational performance are very poor in Jos North Local Government Council.</p>
