            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the findings, it was discovered that the audience feels that local culture is not being projected enough. It is, therefore, pertinent to feature indigenous cultural values on television stations through local programs. The government should also strive to promote culture through other sources other than television. Parents should ensure they imbibe cultural values in the young ones intensively.</p>
                <p>This suggestion and conclusion in this chapter will be in line with the findings of this research work. In the last chapter, it was discovered that foreign films influence behavior. People tend to imitate what they see displayed in foreign films, forgetting that the Western environment is different from ours. This has resulted in many social vices, such as corruption, drug addictions, armed robbery, and the adoption of foreign culture, which does not conform to our national culture and value system.</p>
                <p>Though some of the respondents want foreign films, they are more interested in meaningful ones that have universal appeal. This presents a challenge to indigenous television stations to produce good local programs that will serve both local and regional interests of the nation.</p>
