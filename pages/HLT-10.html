            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The most common reason for discontinuation of Hormonal Contraceptives was shown to be the occurrence of side/adverse effects and the desire of users to have more children.</p>
            
                <p>Factors such as previous pregnancy outcome, economic, socio-demographic considerations, religious beliefs, and partner influence were shown to play a vital role in the choice and usage of hormonal contraceptives.</p>
            
                <p>Unwanted effects such as hypertension, pelvic inflammatory diseases, ectopic pregnancy, and breast tumors were associated with the use of contraceptives in some women. Other side effects such as nausea, spotting, irregular menstruation, mood changes, and weight gain were also associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives in some women, although with various degrees of severity and frequency of occurrence ranging from mild to moderate, and severe in some of the women.</p>
            
                <p>Other women taking drugs for chronic ailments concurrently with these hormonal contraceptives need to monitor changes in their blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and check for significant changes in body weight, etc. Any abnormal change noticed by these women should be reported to their respective health care providers.</p>
