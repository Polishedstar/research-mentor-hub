            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on data presentation, we can therefore state the following findings:</p>
                <p>Political instability, which involves constant changes in leadership, has had a profound impact on organizations. These changes affect not only government organizations but also non-governmental organizations. Political instability disrupts both government and private organizations due to the significant influence of the government in our society.</p>
                <p>The findings reveal that political instability has a highly detrimental effect on the socio-economic development of Nigeria. It has been a major obstacle to socio-economic development in the country, hindering the successful implementation of development plans. The lack of stability has impeded the execution of these plans, as demonstrated by the failure of the first national development plan in 1962-1968, known as the post-independent development plan. This plan was abandoned during the war years when available resources were redirected to preserving the unity of Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Political instability has significantly affected the country's development plans, leading to poor planning and implementation processes, limited financial resources, lack of consultation, high unemployment, and poor communication networks.</p>
                <p>Political stability is crucial for achieving economic stability in Nigeria, as it may attract and encourage investors to invest in the country, thereby promoting the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p>
