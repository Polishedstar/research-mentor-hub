            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work found out that the collapse of organizations or business entities is a major bottleneck in the process of loan or debt recovery.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, from the data obtained from field survey through administered questionnaires and analysis of data in chapter four, it reveals to us that financial mismanagement on the part of business owners and managers is a major cause of organization or business collapse/failure.</p>
                <p>In addition, the research also found that in some instances negligence on the part of financial institutions, especially in examining the customer before issuing out debt facility, is also weak, professionalism and expertise are not being brought to foreplay.</p>
                <p>The research also found that most of the collapsed businesses are not covered by an insurance policy. That lenders of funds could land in safe nets in case of business fold-up to recoup their funds. It also reveals that most businesses do not have collateral that matches their loan demand in terms of monetary value.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the research also discovered that most of the financial institutions, instead of closely analyzing the revenue generation and perfections of business entities before the issuance of a loan facility, they pay more attention to the work of collaterals, which seldom is time-consuming before some of these collaterals are realized.</p>
