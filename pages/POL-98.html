Emerging findings from this research reveal that conflict management as a stage in the handling of conflicts which could be followed by other stages. It also reveals that conflict management is reducing to the barest minimum the prospect of violent expression of disagreements. It further revealed that peace building is a process that aims to impact positively on relations between and among individuals and groups. The findings revealed the nature of conflicts in Jos North to border on issues of identity, poverty, deprivation among others. The study reveals that conflict management impacts positively on peace building in Jos North Local Government of Plateau State.</p>
                <p>Therefore the study stresses that peace building involves addressing social and political causes of conflict as well as reconciliation and it should be continuous and sustained.</p>
                <p>Nigeria has faced grave challenges that have threatened her corporate existence, both in the past and in the present. As daunting as these issues may have been, they are merely raw challenges to the leadership and management abilities of the nation's leaders. Basic conflict management techniques require that in the face of differing challenges, the political and social managers of the nation should select from a portfolio of styles the ones that are most suited to the nation's needs. But above everything else, there must be the will and the weal to do justice to all manner of men - without fear, favour, or ill-will. The Nigerian Federal and State Political leaders must rise to the challenge of the moment to provide leadership where it matters most.</p>
