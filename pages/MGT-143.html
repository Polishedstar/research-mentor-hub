            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                 <p>Based on the data presented, the research puts forward the following findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The research discovered that sales promotion is a useful impact for the development of new products in a manufacturing firm like your company. About 7% of the rate of turnover on new products in manufacturing firms could be attributed to sales promotional actions such as issuance of free samples, radio and television promotional advertisements.</li>
                    <li>Findings also show that most workers and consumers of products from Grand Cereals and Oil Mills Ltd have adequate knowledge about new product development in a manufacturing firm.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, the findings revealed that consumers of the company's products rely on the effective knowledge gained through promotion.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the study, the researcher concluded that sales promotion is a useful tool for new product development in a manufacturing organization. New products are developed and marketed through sales promotion to create awareness among consumers, thereby improving turnover and profit margins for the company. Therefore, promotion enhances new product development in a manufacturing firm.</p>
