            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It's believed that the channel of distribution plays a vital role in the marketing system. Without the channel of distribution system, there would be chaos in the marketing system. They have the following importance:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>They satisfy customers.</li>
                    <li>They generate profit for the business.</li>
                    <li>Producers derive benefits from the channel of distribution system.</li>
                    <li>They make goods available to people.</li>
                    <li>They provide information to both producers and consumers.</li>
                    <li>Distribution channels encourage mass production.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>So, the activities of the channel of distribution are very important, and managers should give them serious attention.</p>
            
                <p>This field study, right from its genesis, was to examine the role of the channel of distribution in the marketing system and thereby make an objective statement concerning the manufacturers, middlemen, and the consumers. Production is sometimes defined as the creation of utility. To bring this to full reality, the distribution activities discussed previously, like transportation, material handling, order processing, warehousing, and inventory control, etc., must be managed by the manufacturer in conjunction with the middlemen. The zeal and proper management of these activities determine the extent to which the goals of the firm can be attained. This will have an impact on the competitive position of the firm in the business environment.</p>
            
                <p>The role of the channel of distribution is not only universal but also dynamic and crucial to the satisfaction of all. However, much that could be achieved in distribution depends on how much has been done and done well too.</p>
