            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the results of the data collected and analyzed, the following summary of findings can be drawn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That the environment of the business has an impact on the company's profit maximization.</li>
                    <li>That the company makes meaningful contributions to the community where it operates.</li>
                    <li>That there is sufficient patronage of the company's products by the people.</li>
                    <li>That the company has competitors, and the presence of competitors has an adverse effect on the company's product survival.</li>
                    <li>That government policies have a great impact on the existence and survival of the organization.</li>
                    <li>That the scientific and technological environment has an effect on the organization's business.</li>
                    <li>That the environment, especially the weather condition, has effects on sales.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the results of the data collected and analyzed, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p>
                <p>Competitors should be considered when determining the business environment, as it is possible for an organization to be affected if the business environment factors are not well considered. Proper recognition of the business environment plays a significant role in the survival of an organization.</p>
                <p>From the above-stated points and data analysis earlier on, it has been revealed that the impact of the business environment is highly significant in the life of Nigerian Bottling Company Plc, Jos.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole discussion, we can conclude that the business environment is the most effective instrument that can be used by the organization to understand the opinions of the general public, government, shareholders, competitors, and others. Conclusively, business environment conditions are related to the survival or failure of an organization.</p>
