            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study focused on the “Management of Active Records in Butambala District Local Government” with the main objective to identify the practices undertaken to manage active records in Butambala District Local Government. This was further broken down into specific objectives including;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To identify the types of records created and received,</li>
                    <li>To identify the use of records to the District Local Government,</li>
                    <li>To find out the filing system used when managing the active-records of Butambala District Local Government, and</li>
                    <li>To identify challenges faced when managing active records and recommend possible measures to address these challenges for the improvement of inactive-records management in Butambala District Local Government.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A lot of findings were discovered in relation to these study objectives as discussed below.</p>
                <h3>Types of Records Created and Received by BDLG.</h3>
                <p>It was found that there are different types of records that are generated and received by Butambala District Local Government. It is discovered that paper-based records are the most types of records generated by BDLG. This is because such records are easy to manage compared to electronic records. Electronic records are also created by the district, though on rare occasions because they are costly in terms of power, hardware, software, and required skills.</p>
                <p>Other types of records that were discovered to be created and received by the district include administrative records, legal records, statistical records, personnel records, project records, case records, procurement records, and ephemera records. Important to note is that ephemera records are records which are disorganized and may not fit in the broad classes of the records established by the classification scheme followed when sorting and organizing records. Such records are not sensitive and do not require strict concern like others.</p>
                <h3>Uses of Active Records to BDLG</h3>
                <p>The study revealed that active records are useful to the district in different aspects. Therefore, records were found to be used to support the administrative work through daily control and management of the district activities. Furthermore, records are used to aid decision making, serve as evidence of the district transactions, records also help to protect human rights, and finally records are paramount when promoting accountability.</p>
                <h3>The Filing Systems Used in the Management of Active Records in BDLG</h3>
                <p>To create a conducive working condition and an orderly office environment, records must be properly filed according to the filing systems established. The study findings revealed that there are different types of filing systems used when managing active records but the ones adopted by BDLG include; alphanumerical filing, numerical filing, alphabetical filing, and geographical filing. It is important to note that the most dominant filing system is alphabetical. This is because this system is widely adopted by most of the government organizations. In addition to that, the advantage of alphabetical filing is that it avoids the need for an index, simple filing, and easy browsing. Contrary to that, alphabetical filing increased the risk of misfiling, retrieval problems due to name changes, increased inefficiency with large systems, and unauthorized persons can locate records.</p>
                <h3>The Challenges Faced When Managing Active Records in BDLG</h3>
                <p>Like any other duties in different professional environments, challenges have in the management of active records in BDLG. Such challenges include loss of records, tremendous growth of technology, delay of records in the action officer’s offices, poor arrangement of records, limited space, poor funding, difficulties in the retrieval of records, and difficulties in tracking the movement of records. All of these factors have been pointed out in the study as the key issues that have crippled the management of records at the district.</p>
                <h3>Possible Solutions That Can Be Put Across to Solve the Challenges Faced When Managing Active Records in BDLG</h3>
                <p>Although a lot of challenges have been experienced by BDLG, possible solutions have been suggested to minimize their effects. The study revealed different possible solutions which include proper shelving of records, installation of fire preventive systems, employing qualified records, application of both automated and manual records management systems, use of bring-up diaries to track the movement of records, conducting records auditing, provision of records management legislations, and finally increasing records security. In conclusion, if all those measures are put into action, all challenges will have to be minimized.</p>
