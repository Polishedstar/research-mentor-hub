            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It was discovered from the questionnaire distributed and responses from those questionnaires that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Microfinance bank has an impact on small and medium-scale enterprises. If funds are available to the banks via the federal government as loans to the bank, this will go a long way in increasing the lending power of the bank to rural dwellers for economic development.</li>
                    <li>It is a common fact that the mobilization rate of microfinance banks is low, as found out in the questionnaire. If increased, small and medium-scale enterprises will become a reality as foreseen by the federal government in establishing the banks, since it is found out that finance is a factor for small and medium-scale enterprises.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the findings above, we can confidently conclude that if adequate provisions of funds are available via disbursement by the federal government to the microfinance banks, it will influence performance in rural areas, hence justifying the topic, "Impact of Microfinance Bank on Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises."</p>
