            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p><strong>Extent Social Media Usage Impacts Studentsâ€™ Performance</strong></p>
                <p>Table One showed the extent to which social media affects academic performance among students in IMSU. From the results above, it was observed that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google, and Twitter are used to a very high extent with standard deviation scores outlined. In line with these findings, Boyd (2017) opined that teenagers, adults including young adults have embraced these sites as a way to connect with their peers, share information, reinvent their personalities, and showcase their social lives at the expense of their study habits to a very high extent.</p>
                <p><strong>Extent Social Media Usage Affects Students Study Time</strong></p>
                <p>Social media, as the name implies, affects the study time of students in IMSU to a very high extent. This was shown in the result in Table Two as identified by their mean scores and standard deviation scores. In line with these findings, Asur and Huberman (2010) indicated that SNS have affected the dynamics of our social groups and friendships.</p>
                <p><strong>Extent Social Media Affects the Learning Behaviour of Students</strong></p>
                <p>In Table Three, it was discovered that social media affects the student learning behaviors to a very high extent. These findings tally with Kaitlin (2010) who said that social networking sites also affect the way we receive information and news as well as our learning behaviors.</p>
