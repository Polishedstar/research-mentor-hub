            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the practical that was carried out in the kitchen and the questionnaire issued out, snacks were produced, and a panel made up of 9 members assessed the products for acceptability. The products included bread, meat pie, cookies, fish roll, queenâ€™s cake using 100% cassava flour and 50% cassava and 50% wheat flour. In scoring the products, appearance, color, taste, texture, aroma, presentation, and remarks were considered. The products received almost the same average scores, which were very good and showed that the acceptability was also very good.</p>
            
                <p>For a country to be self-reliant, its people must be very industrious, and this can only be achieved if our local area food materials are properly utilized. There is a need for our local foodstuffs, such as cereals, legumes, and tubers, from which flour can be obtained, to be enriched to meet the quality recommended for use in the food industry. This will help reduce the high dependency on corn flour or wheat flour. From the observations made, it is evident that cassava flour products were accepted by the taste panelists and can therefore be introduced into the catering industry with the addition of 50% wheat flour to meet the standard quality of the flour.</p>
