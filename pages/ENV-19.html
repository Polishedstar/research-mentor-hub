            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>As mentioned earlier in chapter one, this research was set out to identify the effect of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the field in Quantity Surveying delivery in the Nigerian Construction Industry, three research objectives were adopted in order to collectively satisfy this aim. The study produced some significant findings that are summarized below.</p>
            
                <h3>Objective 1: To identify the ICT products/software used by QS in Nigeria.</h3>
                <p>The findings have shown that the majority of the Quantity Surveyors in the survey use ICT and this was reflected in the responses from table 4.5. The results from the investigation also identified the top three professional software known and in use to be Masterbill (Mean affecting score = 2.64), QS Elite (Mean affecting score = 2.60), and Win QS (Mean affecting score = 2.66). However, none of them scored above the average mean score 3.00, implying that the software is not very popular amongst the Nigerian QS industry.</p>
            
                <h3>Objective 2: To identify the effect of the use of ICT in Quantity Surveying delivery in Nigeria.</h3>
                <p>Based on the review of data from literature, this aspect itemized some activities/operations of quantity surveying roles. It analyzed the level of computerization or digitization of these operations/activities and also the extent of usage of the advanced ICT tools and applications using mean score. The findings illustrated in table 5 have indicated a high ranking level of computerization of most activities and operations identified in this study. It revealed that activities related to Bill preparation, Cost control, Cost planning, Tendering, Final account, Cost modeling. The findings suggest that computerization of these QS roles would highly impact the QS service delivery in the Nigerian construction industry.</p>
            
                <h3>Objective 3: To identify the factors hindering the use of ICT by QS in Nigeria.</h3>
                <p>The factors that hinder the use of ICT by QS in Nigeria can be put into five groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operational hindering factors, which revolve around virus attack leading to loss of data, and associated problems, the rate at which software becomes outdated and requires updating, and few QS software available to choose from.</li>
                    <li>Educational problems identified from the study include QS training institutions not being equipped or positioned to give the required education to their students.</li>
                    <li>Return on investment factors, which revolve around factors such as inadequate jobs in order to encourage investment in computers, high cost of hardware/software, and the cost of engaging computer literate staff being high.</li>
                    <li>Management attitude; this hindering factor is attributed to the management of the organizations that rarely give in-service training to QS staff and are reluctant to see the need to computerize the QS practice.</li>
                    <li>Lastly are the Myth factors, which also include the fear that ICT may create unemployment for QS and hence ICT training and usage are for the coming generation.</li>
                </ul>
