            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of this research, it has been discovered that Small Scale Investment alleviates the rate of unemployment which bedevils the economic position of developing countries. Among its numerous contributions include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Its impact on Gross Domestic Product of the Nigerian Economy.</li>
                    <li>Employment opportunities which foster improvement in the standard of living.</li>
                    <li>Sources of government revenue and a host of other effects.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These achievements are stressed objectives of every developing nation. Credit must be given to this category of business and as such, needs to be provided for with sufficient assistance to the growth of such business as observed in the outcry for financial, managerial, and other related support.</p>
                <p>The constant flow of substandard products in our local markets has been corrected by the overriding plan for efficiency in this kind of business. This is as a result of the remarkable fact that Small Scale Businesses encourage the availability of standard goods and services.</p>
                <p>Small scale investment, if given the enabling environment, could salvage the country from the typical third world poverty to More Developed Countries (MDCs).</p>
                <p>The general economic state of Nigeria does not worth any glory due to overgrowing unemployment rate and corruption. It is evidenced that most citizens have no confidence in the locally manufactured goods and services and as such depend largely on importation. All these shortfalls of Small Scale Business have been seen to be exterminatable only if provided with sufficient relevant support. The problem with the Nigerian Economic Sector is not mainly resources rather, mismanagement of the resources.</p>
                <p>Small Scale Investment and innovations in Nigeria are at the peak of awareness creation and participation by both the people and government. Policies of government have shifted to addressing the problems of infrastructural decay and finance. The problem of power supply is still very much on the ground while the credit framework via microfinance banks put in place to assist entrepreneurs with soft loans is still in its infancy.</p>
                <p>Innovations characterized entrepreneurship and bring about technical progress through capital saving, efficient production techniques, and a higher level of output or economic growth. The small business creates and supplies new lines of consumption to enhance growth in some emphasized entrepreneurial sectors to stimulate growth in various enterprises and industrial organizations.</p>
                <p>However, Nigerian entrepreneurs still face doldrums of problems and challenges in their struggle for innovation and technical progress.</p>
