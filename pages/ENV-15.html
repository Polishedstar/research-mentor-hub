            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The main objective of this study was to find out the level of Sustainable Construction (SC) practices implementation by contractors in the BCI (Built Construction Industry). The results of the study, based on survey opinions of respondents, showed that awareness and implementation of SC is very low, as determined by the non-existence or lack of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in organizations in the built environment. Lack of recognized international EMS within stakeholdersâ€™ organizations in the BCI and low implementation of SC practices can be attributed to low levels of awareness, knowledge, education, and training.</p>
                
                <p>However, the results of this investigation also show that awareness of the importance of the Environmental Assessment Act 2010 among organizations and stakeholders in the BCI is very high. The act is commonly applied in the built environment, which has to do with the compliance requirements from the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) on building construction projects. Stakeholders in the BCI must understand that SC practices implementation is not limited to compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Assessment Act. Uptake of recognized international voluntary assessment tools such as BREEAM, LEED, and Green Star, for example, affords opportunities to push boundaries on SC by using an innovation category within their tools.</p>
                
                <p>The investigations of this study have also shown that raising awareness, prioritizing important SC drivers, reducing critical SC barriers, and government taking the lead on implementation can be supplemented by SC practice incentives. Incentives can be related to monetary benefits for project sponsors and all stakeholders in the form of awarding grants, discounted interest rates, taxes, and fees associated with council's development charges, which are popular incentives that government can implement.</p>
                
                <p>Objective two of this study was concerned with identifying the main stakeholders in BCI. Through data gathering analysis of survey participants' opinions, government through various departments and parastatals was pointed out as the main stakeholder because government is the biggest client and project sponsor in BCI. However, study findings also suggested that all stakeholders in the built environment have a role to play in the implementation of SC. Government is an important stakeholder and can lead the implementation of SC principles in the built environment by applying voluntary assessment and awarding certification on major construction projects as a way of setting a precedence. However, lack of knowledge or awareness of the Botswana Green Building Council (BGBC), which has finished adjusting the Green Star Rating Tool to meet BCI conditions, has to be addressed.</p>
                
                <p>The third objective of this study was to identify important drivers of SC drivers in the BCI. The findings of this study show that the top five drivers of SC are; environment or resource preservation, waste reduction, water conservation, education or training, and increased awareness from clients.</p>
                
                <p>Environment or resource preservation is the most important SC driver, and it can be explained by the amount of land Botswana has under protection for game reserves, making it a top driver for SC. Waste reduction, water conservation, education and training, and increasing awareness from clients are also significant drivers of SC in the BCI.</p>
                
                <p>The fourth objective of this study was to identify critical barriers to the adoption of SC practices in the BCI. The study found and ranked the top five barriers as; the tendency to maintain current practices, lack of awareness from clients, limited supply of sustainable materials and products, limited sustainable knowledge and understanding from contractors, and the recovery of long-term savings not reflected in service fee structure.</p>
                
                <p>Results of this study have shown that the biggest barrier of SC practices in BCI is the tendency to maintain current practices. Building regulations, codes, and standards have to be perpetually updated to accommodate new innovative sustainable products in the BCI. Lack of awareness from clients, limited supply of sustainable materials and products, limited sustainable knowledge and understanding from contractors, and the recovery of long-term savings not reflected in service fee structure are also significant barriers to SC implementation.</p>
