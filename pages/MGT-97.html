            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research has attempted to review the question of manpower training and development in Industrial Training Fund (ITF) with particular reference to the impact of training and development on the performance of its employees.</p>
                <p>In chapter one, being an introductory chapter, a general description of the area of study was made. This is followed by the statement of the problem, objectives of the study, its scope and significance, statements of hypothesis, research methodology, limitations of the research, and chapter scheme.</p>
                <p>In chapter two (Literature review), an attempt was made to define training and development as seen by various writers, experts, and analysis on manpower training and development. One common thing about all the definitions is that the writers see training as an organized process of learning or acquisition of how or additional knowledge, skills, behavior, or attitude by an individual for the purpose of satisfactory performance of a job. In the same vein, the writers also defined development as a systematic process by which individuals gain and apply knowledge, skills, insights, and attitudes to realize their potentials for growth in an organization.</p>
                <p>In the same chapter, an attempt was also made to look at the concept of manpower training and development with a view to understanding the major theory which underlines the whole training and development activity. The general principles which emerge from this theory may be summarized under pre-training and development conditions, objectives in training and development, and processes of training and development.</p>
                <p>The literature review also attempted to spell out the roles which manpower training and development plays in achieving organizational goals. Such roles include implementing and completing employee selection process; increasing employee’s motivation; reducing learning time to reach acceptable performance by new employees, improving employee skills and consequently increasing the quantity and quality of output, helping experienced employees increase their level of performance, reducing employee turnover, absenteeism, accidents, grievance rate, low morale, excessive waste and scrap loss, poor work methods, poor customer service, etc., helping in molding employee attitudes to achieve better cooperation, greater loyalty, and support for company activities, helping organizations fill their manpower needs, enhancing employees’ market value, career power, promotability; and finally increasing returns for both the employers and the employees.</p>
                <p>Under the same heading, the review also attempts to define and explain what a training need is and how it can be discovered or identified through the identification of organizational and training problems such as high cost, poor material control, product quality, high employee turnover, etc.</p>
                <p>Finally, the chapter attempts to define employee performance and how it is used to measure the worth of training in terms of job behavior effects and results effects by way of evaluation. The data includes a historical background of Industrial Training Fund (ITF) and the organization of manpower training and development activities in the company.</p>
                <p>Chapter four consists of the presentation and analysis of the collected data in order to test the hypotheses. It also consists of findings made after analyzing the data. Analysis of tables shows that an average of over 500 employees (about 59% of the total workforce) are trained every year.</p>
                <p>Finally, the analysis has revealed that most training coordinators evaluate courses/workshops organized by them during training and after training at the level of job behavior effects.</p>
