            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>For any business firm to be successful in their business conducting and giving attention to promotional mix elements is a critical part of their successful activity. It is better for all business firms to manage and follow up their promotional activities to be known in the market. Even if the company's profitability is the sum of different functions such as finance, marketing, and other departments, promotional mix elements also play a great impact on its success through creating a good public image, knowledge about the company's product, and increasing the amount of sales volume. Having this into consideration, this research work also tries to study and show the impact of promotional mix elements on the amount of sales volume.</p>
                <p>The conclusion from the analysis of respondents is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most of Globacom company respondents were male who were found in different age ranges and educational levels.</li>
                    <li>There were a lot of respondents who had not heard or listened about the company's products.</li>
                    <li>The company uses different promotional advertising media such as radio, television, booklet, promotional board, and newspaper. But their degree is different from one another. Radio and television cover a majority part of advertising media. The promotional strategy currently used by Globacom company is less attractive and creates no motivation to buy the company's products. On the other hand, the respondents also replied that it was less attractive in relation to other related companies. But most respondents indicate that the company's promotion is showing improvement from time to time.</li>
                    <li>Most respondents replied that the promotion and quality of the company's product are related, but their promotion did not increase the customer frequency to buy the company's product due to the outdated promotion method.</li>
                    <li>The company uses different types of advertising mix elements such as advertising, personal selling, public relations, and sales promotion. The company performs these different promotional mix elements to announce its product to different kinds of people.</li>
                    <li>The company does not have a well-organized promotion department independently of other departments. And also, the company's budget for promotion is not independent and separate from other budgets. This results in the company's promotional practices being perceived as poor by customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To sum up, communication is a highly substitutable product, thus it requires quite an attractive promotional activity and well design which meets the needs and specifications of the customers. Moreover, good promotional activity helps the company increase sales volume. Finally, the company faces different problems related to promotional activity, so the company is expected to overcome these problems to achieve its objectives.</p>
