            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the results from Chapter Four of the study, the following views about the impact of communication on organizational performance can be derived:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The performance of workers is dependent on effective communication. A free and efficient flow of information and a well-established communication system lead to increased worker performance and accuracy compared to situations with communication barriers.</li>
                    <li>The environment of an organization affects communication. Organizational structure plays a significant role in how communication is conducted. Well-structured organizations with hierarchies may have more formal communication processes, whereas less structured organizations may have faster but less formal communication.</li>
                    <li>Communication influences the peace and stability within an organization. Good and effective communication allows individuals to share information, views, feelings, and perceptions, promoting peace and enhancing stability within the organization.</li>
                    <li>Both private and public organizations experience lapses or barriers in the flow of information. Communication management issues can arise in various organizations, leading to communication challenges.</li>
                    <li>Communication is a vital instrument for promoting the effective and efficient performance of workers within an organization.</li>
