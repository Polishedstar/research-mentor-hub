            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings of the result revealed that the pervasive nature of fuel prices is increasing economic hardships and growing poverty in Nigeria. Economic growth contributes to the prosperity of the economy and was revealed to be desirable because it enables the economy to consume and contribute to more goods and services by increasing investment, an increase in the labor force, efficient use of inputs to expand output, and technological progressiveness. Any nation that experiences economic development and growth was said to have benefited from an improvement in living standards, especially if the Government can assist in growth by implementing complementary and growth-enhancing monetary and fiscal policies, whereas a hike in fuel prices has hampered economic growth.</p>
            
                <p>From the study, it was strongly affirmed that incidences of fuel price hikes have been known to push up transportation costs. In the same vein, the study showed that fluctuations in fuel prices lead to a great loss in the output of the nation.</p>
            
                <p>Also, fuel hikes affect the price of goods, affect the rate of purchase of goods and services, and reduce the profits made by retailers and wholesalers. It was discovered that subsidies on imported petroleum products are considered to be an important instrument for keeping fuel prices stable. Fuel subsidy removal will result in an increase in Nigerian GDP, but fuel subsidy removal will have a detrimental impact on poor households.</p>
            
                <p>Furthermore, it was revealed that fuel hikes reduce the supply of food, reduce the patronage of customers, and cause a reduction in the value of food commodities.</p>
