            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of achieving the aim of this research, the study assessed the types of organizational culture, the level of importance attached to the types of organizational culture, the effect of organizational culture on the performance of quantity surveying firms, as well as the challenges to the formalization of organizational culture in quantity surveying firms. The conclusions drawn from these aspects are as follows:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Quantity surveying firms are largely either sole proprietorship or partnership business structures, resulting in a higher number of junior-level quantity surveyors in the firms due to the absence of multiple leadership.</li>
                    <li>Quantity surveying firms exhibit multiple cultures, with competitiveness and stability cultures being dominant (ranked 1st and 2nd, respectively), while innovation and reward cultures are the least dominant (ranked 6th and 7th).</li>
                    <li>Despite the presence of multiple cultures, the three hierarchies within quantity surveying firms share commonality in the perception of the dominant organizational culture, as indicated by the insignificant differences in the ranking of the dominant type of organizational culture.</li>
                    <li>Stability culture, performance orientation culture, and competitiveness culture are the types of organizational culture that quantity surveying firms ascribe the most importance to (ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively). Contrary to the literature, innovation culture is the least important type of organizational culture.</li>
                    <li>All types of organizational culture have positive relationships with one or more performance measures. Additionally, all types of organizational culture (except supportiveness culture) have an influence on one or more performance measures in quantity surveying firms.</li>
                    <li>Reward and stability cultures influence the highest number of performance measures (five and six, respectively) in quantity surveying firms. Competitiveness and performance orientation cultures influence the second-highest number of performance measures. Customer and employee satisfaction are solely influenced by reward and stability cultures.</li>
                    <li>The leaders and employees of quantity surveying firms (Principal partner, senior quantity surveyors, and junior quantity surveyors) are not the challenges to the formalization of organizational culture in quantity surveying firms. Management structuring challenges, lack of resources, and lack of formal education on organizational culture are the primary challenges to the formalization of organizational culture in quantity surveying firms (ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively).</li>
