            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study determined staff opinion concerning inadequate work motivation and compensation of workers and how it affects performance in an organization. The majority of the respondents stated that the workers are not happy with the situation, leading to a decrease in their work commitment. Staff opinions also highlighted the relationship between poor work attitude by workers and its impact on performance. It is inferred that the management should address these issues to achieve organizational goals, in line with the traditional values of public service, emphasizing equity, probity, integrity, moral conduct, and political neutrality.</p>
                <p>The research has shown that the Civil Service Commission has criteria to promote staff and enhance organizational performance within the civil service. However, the Commission faces critical challenges in terms of performance to enhance service delivery in Plateau State. There are prospects that the government can improve the Commission's needs through better communication, motivation, and involving staff in management decisions to boost their work attitude.</p>
                <p>Human Management encourages the survival, growth, and profitability of public sector organizations, especially the civil service commission. The findings of this research work align with the views and findings in related literature reviewed in the previous chapter, confirming that effective human resource management is essential for organizational performance. An organization's performance is closely tied to the performance of its employees. To achieve this, staff should find their work meaningful, and this can be achieved through creating a positive working environment and continuous performance improvement.</p>
                <p>Human resource managers play a vital role in achieving these goals. Human resource management practices are designed to provide eligible and qualified employees to enhance organizational performance and effectiveness. These practices, if fully implemented, contribute to increased organizational effectiveness by ensuring a positive employee experience, retention, and long-term employment. Human resource management is a key function for an effective and efficient organization.</p>
