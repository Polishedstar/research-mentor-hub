            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The paper has examined the relationship between academic performance and the entry requirements for Architecture students into the Nigerian Universities. It has established that there is a low correlation between a student's academic performance and their basic knowledge of physics and mathematics, which was found to be contrary to the expectations of many scholars and architectural education policy-makers.</p>
                <p>It attributed this variance to the lack of students' experience in drawing and other artistic skills, which they ought to have gained during their secondary education. The contradiction was also traced to an inefficient examination system characterized by cases of examination malpractice and inadequate assessment mechanisms.</p>
                <p>According to the paper, any results obtained through this system could not reflect the true ability of the students. Thus, a school of architecture that bases its admission criteria on the system stands the chance of granting admission to poor students who will ultimately turn out to be half-baked graduates.</p>
