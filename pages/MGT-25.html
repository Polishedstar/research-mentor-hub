            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study rejects the hypothesis Ho, which states that the application of the 4Ps of marketing strategy is not adequate to conduct effective service marketing in the tourism and hospitality service industry in Plateau State. Instead, it accepts H1, which states that the application of the 4Ps of marketing is effective for service marketing in the tourism and hospitality service industry in Plateau State. The implication is that the tourism and hospitality service industry in Plateau State has not developed enough to include the remaining 3 Ps of the 7Ps marketing strategy for effective service marketing.</p>
                <p>Table 10 further supports this opinion, indicating that the tourism and hospitality service industry in Plateau State can be developed through the application of the 4Ps of the marketing strategy. Table 7 also shows that the level of development of the tourism and hospitality service industry is still low in Plateau State.</p>
                <h3>5.3 Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Based on the research findings and summary, the research study concludes that the tourism and hospitality service industry in Plateau State can achieve its potentials by applying all the 7Ps of service marketing strategy. More emphasis should be placed on the 4Ps because of the current level of development in the tourism and hospitality service industry.</p>
