            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the topic under research, "the judiciary as an effective tool for the maintenance of peace and stability in Nigeria," the researcher finds out that the judiciary arm of government is responsible for interpreting the law of the land and applying it in situations where they are necessary. This makes the job of the judiciary a very critical one. The law of the land constitutes the basis upon which judgments are ruled; it is, therefore, fundamental that its interpretation and application be carried out with absolute alacrity and meticulousness.</p>
            
                <p>The research work also revealed that the judicial system in Nigeria is beset with several deficiencies in its procedural setup that make it very difficult to obtain justice and quick resolution of disputes in courts. Most of the procedural rules of the various courts in Nigeria are in dire need of reform and review to make them accord with the need to discard technicalities and uphold substantive justice. A situation where many cases in Nigerian courts take years to be resolved does not bode well for the judicial system and encourages resort to self-help by disgruntled litigants.</p>
            
                <p>The fight against corruption, as stated earlier, is a collective one, and all hands must indeed be on deck to ensure a corruption-free Nigeria. The judiciary, which is the final arbiter in our criminal justice system, must be well poised and prepared, both intellectually and otherwise, to handle the great challenges posed by the ever-changing dynamics and face of corruption. It must first purge and cleanse itself of all forms of corruption and discharge its duties without fear and favor.</p>
            
                <p>As a corollary of the foregoing, the study proved that a greater prospect for the rule of law and due process pervading a society, particularly at the diffusion of basic honesty as a way of life, and that economic actors in their commercial relationships would not normally lie, cheat, or steal when not under immediate threat of detection and sanction.</p>
            
                <p>Therefore, if the various roles identified for the Bar in this project, together with the recommendations put forth, are given practical trial, it will make the dream of a peaceful country a reality. Nigeria needs and deserves real peace and not the peace of the graveyard.</p>
