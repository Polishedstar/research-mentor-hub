            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study examines the influence of board characteristics on earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria. The study hypothesizes that board size, board independence, board financial expertise, board meetings, and women directors have no significant impact on earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>A correlational research design was used. The data was collected purely from secondary sources using the annual reports and accounts of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria for the period of ten years, 2005 to 2014. The population of the study is the entire listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria, out of which seven firms were used as a sample for the study. Multiple regression was employed to empirically examine the relationship among the variables. Random Effect GLS Regression was used.</p>
                <p>The study provides evidence of a negative and statistically significant relationship between board size and earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria. It further documents that board independence is positively and significantly related to earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria. A negative significant relationship was also found between board financial expertise and earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria. It also found a positive significant relationship between board meetings and earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria. While women directors were found to be positively insignificantly related to earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria. Finally, the control variable firm size was found to be negatively and significantly related to earnings management of listed food and beverage firms in Nigeria.</p>
