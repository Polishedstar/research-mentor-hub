            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
              <p>As a result of the research conducted, the following complementary measures of bank failure in Nigeria and complementary solutions to bank failure have been discovered:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Bank failure has had a negative impact on the development of the Nigerian economy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Assets and Liability Management:</strong> Poor assets and liability management by banks have negatively affected the development of the Nigerian economy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Banking Reforms:</strong> The recent banking reforms in Nigeria have brought about positive changes in the economy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Recapitalization:</strong> Recapitalization of the banking sector is expected to address the growing problem of bank failures in the country.</li>
                  <li><strong>Role of Banks:</strong> Banks hold a unique position for effective growth and development in Nigeria.</li>
                  <li><strong>Loss of Confidence:</strong> Poor banking systems lead to a loss of confidence among both the public and private investors.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In general, bank failure in Nigeria is attributed to corruption, poor banking management, inadequate asset management, weak capital bases of banks, excessive government interference, unqualified and untrained manpower, non-repayment of loans by customers, and ineffective marketing strategies.</p>
