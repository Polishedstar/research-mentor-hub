            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the data analyzed in previous chapters, the researcher discovered the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It was revealed that after-sale service is the marketing activity performed after a sale has been made, a means of deep insight into customers, purchased goods, and the bedrock of customers' relationship with the organization.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that after-sale service influences the purchase of industrial goods because it leads to effective utilization of purchased goods. After-sale service has provided customer satisfaction, customer relaxation, and continuous patronage, thereby encouraging customer loyalty. Also, revealed that after-sale service reduces customers' cost of maintenance on purchased industrial goods through preventive maintenance.</li>
                    <li>After-sale service increases the profitability and market share of any competitive market because when the level of patronage of industrial goods increases, the profitability level will also increase, just like the market share.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From the above findings, the impact of after-sale service cannot be over-emphasized. Companies need after-sale service to get ahead of the competition, and a recall executed after-sale should be able to increase the relationship between the company and its customers, tailoring towards the company's objectives or goals. A deep insight into customers' purchased goods and the bedrock of customers' relationship with the organization was one among many findings.</p>
                <p>To end this, despite the challenges faced by after-sale service on the purchase of industrial goods, the service has a lot of effect on customers and the organization, such as customer satisfaction, reduced cost, and service as feedback for an organization's product or services.</p>
