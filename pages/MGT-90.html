            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Findings from the research work revealed that sales promotion is an effective tool for motivating customersâ€™ patronage and helps the organization to achieve sustainable growth. This is based on the fact that once customers are motivated, they patronize the organization's product more and make positive comments on the product, which attracts new customers.</p>
                <p>The finding also revealed that during sales promotion, customers are lured into buying above their usual quantity, which helps the organization to increase its sales, thereby covering the overhead cost of sales promotion.</p>
                <p>It is also important to note that from the findings, it is revealed that during sales promotion, organizations encountered problems in one way or the other. This entails that there are some hurdles such as lack of funds, lack of trained personnel, among others, which hinders the success of the organization.</p>
                <p>It is also worthy to mention here that those organizations that refused to use sales promotion do so at the detriment of losing their customers because customers are motivated when they feel the impact of their money.</p>
                <p>From the oral interview, questionnaires administered and analyzed, secondary data gathered, it is evident that sales promotion is an effective tool in motivating customers' patronage. The research showed that sales promotion is an effective promotional tool that induces old customers to be loyal to the organization. This is proved in the sense that customers patronize Unilever products more during sales promotion and, in the process of rushing for the organization's product as a result of sales promotion, they become regular users who would not want to patronize competitors' products.</p>
                <p>It is also important to note that sales promotion is an effective tool that induces new customers. I observed that during sales promotion, new customers always want to take advantage of the period to satisfy their immediate need or to gain the value of their money by buying more at a cheaper rate. In doing this, they consciously or unconsciously find themselves becoming regular users of the product once the product satisfies their need. So the organization, in addition to sales promotion, must provide want-satisfying products.</p>
                <p>Moreover, sales promotion helps Unilever to achieve its objectives. The study revealed that customers buy more during sales promotion, and this has a positive effect on the organization's objectives because the more customers buy, the more the sales volume will increase, and this will go a long way in building the organization's strength to compete favorably with the competitors.</p>
                <p>It is also revealed that if sales promotion is not properly planned, it will make the organization incur unnecessary costs, which are detrimental to the existence of the organization. Therefore, costs associated with sales promotion must be properly taken into consideration, lest the organization will not see the value of the concept.</p>
                <p>Finally, organizations may not succeed in sales promotion sometimes because of the heavy cost involved and the lack of trained personnel who will execute the concept effectively. As I stated earlier, the organization should prepare adequate funding for sales promotion, and staff should be well trained because even if the organization uses the entire revenue it generates for sales promotion and fails to use the right personnel who can execute the program well, it will not succeed.</p>
                <p>From the above points, I confidently advise organizations that are using sales promotion to put more effort into using the concept because it is an effective tool for motivating customers. And for those organizations that use the concept with laxity or those who refuse to use the concept at all, I advise that they should imbibe the concept of sales promotion.</p>
