            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the analysis in this study, the following are the summary of findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That the Gbong Gwom Jos plays a vital role in conflict management in Jos South Local Government.</li>
                    <li>That transformation of conflict is very expedient for organizations to turn conflicts into the basis of future cooperation among social entities.</li>
                    <li>That the causes of conflict in Jos South are politically motivated, ethnic, religious, and related to resource control.</li>
                    <li>That clashes between herders and farmers, religious motivations, and ethnicity are the factors fueling violent conflicts in Jos South Local Government.</li>
                    <li>That the efforts made by the Gbong Gwom Jos in Jos South Local Government in conflict management and conflict resolution bring about reconciliation, reconstruction, and rehabilitation, as is the case in many local governments, organizations in Jos South, and human life in general.</li>
                    <li>That the present socio-economic conditions of the local people in the local government are not satisfactory despite conflict management strategies in place.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As inferred from the study, conflict management is the process of limiting the negative aspects of conflict while increasing its positive aspects. It is the principle that all conflicts cannot necessarily be resolved, but learning how to manage conflicts can decrease the odds of nonproductive escalation. Transformation of conflict is also very expedient for us to turn conflicts into the basis of future cooperation among social entities.</p>
                <p>Traditional conflict management and peacebuilding practices reflect principles of reconciliation based on long-term conflict transformation, peaceable relationships, and values. These customary efforts seem to be effective in addressing intra-community and even inter-community conflicts where relationships and shared values form the bases of the reconciliation processes.</p>
                <p>The challenge facing Jos South is how to make conflicts constructive rather than destructive, marginal rather than fundamental, peripheral rather than pivotal. The Gbong Gwom must address the root causes of conflicts in the polity - the historic wrongs and injustice that engender strife and conflicts - build a pluralist democratic state where the rights of all citizens are respected, seek to blend power with principle and reconcile authority with freedom, and put a robust Peace Infrastructure in place to play a preventive and mitigating role.</p>
