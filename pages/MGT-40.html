            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings of the result revealed that small and medium-scale enterprises have a significant impact on the economic growth of Jos Metropolis. Economic growth contributes to the prosperity of the economy, enabling it to consume and contribute to more goods and services through increased investment, an expanded labor force, efficient resource utilization, and technological progress.</p>
                <p>It was strongly affirmed that small and medium-scale enterprises have increased in number and positively impacted the economy of Jos Metropolis, especially in terms of employment generation. Various entrepreneurs have engaged in businesses like livestock farming, fisheries, laundry and dry-cleaning services, shoe production, tailoring, barbering, and burnt bricklaying as medium enterprises.</p>
                <p>Small and medium-scale enterprises have contributed significantly to the economic development of Jos Metropolis. These enterprises have provided employment opportunities and vocational training to empower youths for job creation. Challenges such as managerial capability, productivity, and efficiency were identified in these enterprises during interviews with operators.</p>
                <p>Nigeria, with its large economy and resourceful population, offers abundant entrepreneurship opportunities across various sectors. Reducing unemployment and improving living standards through income, new goods, and services are direct and indirect benefits of entrepreneurship in poverty reduction.</p>
                <p>Efforts to decrease unemployment are hindered by over-dependence on crude oil and government revenue. Entrepreneurship can bring about the needed technical innovation and redistribution of employment opportunities. Prioritizing skills acquisition, rural development, agriculture, animal husbandry, community participation, and more can help reduce poverty and enhance rural livelihoods.</p>
                <p>Government roles in encouraging entrepreneurship, pro-poor growth, and poverty reduction through various policies and initiatives, such as international trade, taxation, education, and infrastructure development, cannot be overemphasized. Entrepreneurship and value addition, when supported by adequate infrastructure, can significantly reduce poverty.</p>
