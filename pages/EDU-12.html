            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study was designed to find out from students the ways in which they participate in administrative decision-making in the governance of secondary schools in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State.</p>
                <p>Related literatures covering conceptual, theoretical, and empirical studies were reviewed. The theoretical literature revealed that decentralized decision-making which involves members from the different levels or groups of an organization enhances administrative effectiveness. This was supported by empirical literature even though it was obvious that studies on students' participation in decision-making were sparse.</p>
                <p>Five research questions and four hypotheses were formulated to guide the study.</p>
                <p>The research design adopted was descriptive survey design. The population of the study was 145,840 with a sample of 1,200 final year students from four secondary schools in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. The sample was drawn through proportionate stratified random sampling technique.</p>
                <p>The responses were scored, and the collected data was summarized and statistically analyzed using mean and standard deviation and t-test analysis to test the hypotheses. A forty (40) item structured questionnaire titled students' participation in administrative decision-making questionnaire (SPADMQ) was the instrument for data collection. The questionnaire was validated by 5 experts from the Department of Educational Foundations and through test-retest reliability analysis, the instrument was accepted to be reliable enough for the study.</p>
                <p>The findings of the study were summarized as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students are represented in Secondary School disciplinary committees in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. In other words, students and members of staff constitute members of students' disciplinary committee, students contribute freely to matters relating to students' discipline, and students try cases and report their findings to the Secondary School authority. Students also admitted that students have the right to appeal to a higher body, admit punishment with respect to the offense committed, and generally take part in the discipline of their fellow students.</li>
                    <li>Students in federal and state secondary schools do not participate in formulating the rules operating in the secondary schools, and their suggestions are not always considered when rules are formulated. Students are not adequately represented in students' parliament. Federal and state secondary schools have students' parliament in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State, but they are not adequately represented in students' parliament.</li>
                    <li>Students in federal and state secondary schools do not participate in deciding hostel accommodation fee, how much to pay for hostel services, in discussing an increase in accommodation fee, and students' views are not considered on the number of students that can stay in a room. Students in both federal and state secondary schools also do not meet with the Secondary School authorities to discuss problems of electricity supply, and they are not always comfortable with the state of hostel accommodation.</li>
                    <li>Students in federal secondary schools participate to some extent in the decision to pay some money to register their courses, tuition fee, examination fee, academic regulation, library services, sport fee, fieldwork, and suggest to the Secondary School authority what fee students should pay. Students in state secondary schools do not participate in the decision to pay some money to register their course, tuition fee, examination fee, academic regulation, library services, sport fee, laboratory fee, fieldwork, and their views are not usually sought and considered before an increase in registration fee. Students of federal and state secondary schools are not always happy when registration fee is increased without informing them.</li>
                    <li>In both federal and state secondary schools, in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State, students participate in the election of students' leaders. That is, student leaders are elected by students, and the list is forwarded to the Secondary School authority for approval. Elections are held regularly to elect students' leaders in federal secondary schools only, and the Secondary School authority allows students to conduct elections regularly. Generally, students and the Secondary School authority jointly choose students' leaders, also in federal secondary schools.</li>
