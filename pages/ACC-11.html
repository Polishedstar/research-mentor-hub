            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The topic "The Effect of Monetary Policy on Commercial Banks Savings" has been studied to understand the impact of policies such as Open Market Operation (OMO), Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), bank rates, and other modern tools on the ability of commercial banks to provide loans for the public's savings. It has also been investigated whether these policies affect customers' savings behavior and the banks, either positively or negatively. Data was collected through questionnaires administered to bank staff and customers and from official documents, with a focus on First Bank Plc.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the collected data was based on the simple percentage method. The findings in Chapter Four revealed that when the Central Bank mops up more money from commercial banks through the issuance of treasury bills, it reduces the banks' liquidity and discourages them from lending, which, in turn, affects customers' ability to save. Additionally, a high percentage of cash liquidity reserve requirements and high-interest rates also discourage banks from lending and affect savings. The lower the ability of commercial banks to provide loans or create more money, the higher their willingness to lend.</p>
                <p>Based on the findings, it can be concluded that commercial banks are usually discouraged when the Central Bank mops up most of their liquidity reserve through the issuance of treasury bills or sets a high percentage of liquidity reserve requirements. Prioritizing certain sectors of the economy can also affect commercial banks' willingness to lend, which, in turn, impacts savings and the overall money supply in the economy. It's important to note that commercial banks charge interest on loans, which acts as compensation for parting with liquidity. A change in interest rates clearly affects the lending ability of commercial banks and their customers.</p>
