            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study determined staff opinions concerning inadequate work motivation and compensation of workers and how it affects performance in an organization. The majority of the respondents indicated that workers are not happy with the situation, and as a result, they no longer put in their best effort at work. Staff opinions regarding the relationship between poor work attitudes by workers and their impact on performance suggest that management should address their nonchalant attitude to achieve organizational goals. This aligns with the traditional values of public service, emphasizing equity, probity, integrity, moral conduct, and political neutrality.</p>
                <p>The research also revealed that the Civil Service Commission has criteria for promoting staff and enhancing organizational performance within the civil service. However, the Commission faces significant challenges in terms of performance and service delivery in Plateau State. There are prospects for the government to improve the Commission's needs by fostering a positive relationship between management and staff. Including staff in management meetings and decision-making processes can motivate them and enhance their work attitudes.</p>
                <p>Human resource management is essential for the survival, growth, and profitability of public sector organizations, especially the Civil Service Commission. The findings of this research work are consistent with the views and findings in related literature reviewed in the previous chapter, highlighting the significance of effective human resource management in achieving organizational performance. Employee performance is the most critical factor in determining organizational success, as improving individual performance can lead to enhanced organizational performance.</p>
                <p>Human resource managers play a crucial role in creating a meaningful work environment for staff, promoting continuous performance improvement, and ensuring the retention of employees. Effective human resource management practices aim to provide qualified and eligible employees, ultimately increasing organizational effectiveness and achieving the organization's specified functions. HRM is key to the success of an organization.</p>
