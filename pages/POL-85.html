            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The study revealed that manpower training improves job performance and productivity in an organization.</li>
                    <li>Manpower training enhances employees' training in Universal Basic Education.</li>
                    <li>Staff are evaluated during and after training.</li>
                    <li>Training and development in the organization have improved productivity, skills, and expertise knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Manpower training programs have contributed to the achievement of the organization's goals.</li>
                    <li>Training motivates subordinates to work harder and make a more effective contribution to the achievement of the organization's goals.</li>
                    <li>Training has improved the performance of experienced workers in the organization.</li>
                    <li>Training has assisted in molding the attitude of staff (subordinates) to give the organization better cooperation, greater loyalty, and better support.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Having carried out an analytical study of manpower training, the belief in academic circles and work settings that training enhances the performance of employees on their jobs is true. This conclusion is drawn from the finding that there is a direct relationship between employees' performance on the job and their level of training and development. The positive responses given by the respondents in the questionnaires administered confirm this conclusion.</p>
