            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>            
                <p>This study identified and assessed the various methods of procurement used for construction works in Ondo State, Nigeria. It has also identified and assessed the various factors that affect the choice of procurement methods for construction works in Ondo State, Nigeria. It has also been able to establish the relationship that exists between the procurement method used and the cost and time performance of the construction projects in Ondo State, Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>Therefore, it is concluded from the study that the direct labor method of procurement is the most used and considered the easiest procurement method in terms of its process and activities for the procurement of construction works in the public sector in Ondo State.</p>
            
                <p>An examination of the factors that affect the selection of construction procurement methods also reveals that complexity, i.e., the need to have a competent contractor to handle the client's unique and high-technology requirements and whose design and construction skills can be relied upon to satisfy their requirements in terms of the project's characteristics and the services involved, is the most significant factor to be considered in choosing a procurement method for construction works in the public sector of Ondo State, Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>It follows then that consideration should be given to selecting a procurement method which will help to objectively assess the contractors in order to select one who can successfully achieve the client's objectives and technical requirements. Once this can be accomplished, then the client's need for other important factors such as speed, time, and cost certainty, and achieving value for money and public accountability can be achieved. Thus, a successful project can be realized.</p>
