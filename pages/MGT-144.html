            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the result of data collected and analyzed, the following summary of findings can be drawn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Businesses located in urban areas enjoy infrastructural amenities, value chains, and labor supply with different skill sets.</li>
                    <li>Businesses in rural locations enjoy labor cost advantages, quality of life, and strong cultural and institutional frameworks.</li>
                    <li>Business location is a highly salient factor that influences the success of Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises in Plateau state.</li>
                    <li>Business location is important for both competitiveness and protection from competition.</li>
                    <li>Geographical barriers have greatly affected the supply chain of Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises' products and services.</li>
                    <li>Good accessibility is an essential factor to consider when siting a Small and Medium-Scale Enterprise.</li>
                    <li>The choice of location varies according to the size of the Small and Medium-Scale enterprise and the nature of business activities.</li>
                    <li>Business location is a major determinant of customer patronage and sales volume.</li>
                    <li>Business location plays a vital role in entrepreneurship development.</li>
                    <li>Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises play a key role in entrepreneurship development in Plateau state.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Many start-up mistakes can sometimes be remedied, but a poor location decision is difficult and sometimes impossible to change (The staff of entrepreneur media, 2015). The location of a business significantly impacts the business's survival. Each location choice provides various potentials, opportunities, and sometimes threats which often emerge as an advantage or an impediment. It is therefore imperative that business owners and managers pay attention and seriously consider the factors that will determine the quality of their location decisions.</p>
                <p>Given the high level of business failure among Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises all over the world and in Plateau state in particular, the study is a contribution to the understanding of new ventures in the area of location decisions. This research has presented the effect of business location on Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises in Plateau state. Particularly, the research investigated the degree to which the predetermined variables (accessibility, site's image, and parking spaces) affect the dependent variable, which is business performance.</p>
                <p>The research established that among all the variables, good accessibility has the strongest and positive relationship with business performance. It was also discovered that site image and parking spaces have a relationship with business performance. Nevertheless, the theoretical results show that all three independent variables influence location decisions and, therefore, business performance. Furthermore, more companies should sponsor programs and conferences to share ideas and experiences on the importance of business location and criteria for location analysis to enable Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises to make informed location selection decisions for their businesses.</p>
