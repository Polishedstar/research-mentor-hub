            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focuses on the communication skills and its effect on effective management in an organization. The findings revealed that management places a high value on effective organizational communication but most of them are not skilled/competent, so there is a need in acquiring the basic communication skills/competencies that will stimulate their effort towards the achievement of stipulated goals.</p>
                <p>Also, communication has a significant effect on an organization because it influences and strengthens the daily routine of workers for better working processes and coordinates their activities.</p>
                <p>The findings revealed that managers and subordinates' roles in communication can ensure the realization of integrative action of teamwork. It also shows that communication barriers are symptoms of more deeply rooted problems that are negatively affecting most organizations and need to be addressed.</p>
                <p>The study also shows that effective listening, simplifying language, planning of messages before passing them across to the receiver, and individual ideas, perceptions, and contributions towards communication are the basic principles and ways for effective communication.</p>
                <p>This study is meant to evaluate the basic communication skills and their effects on effective management in an organization.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that communication skills are a strategic point for managers and very important for effective leadership because they help ensure organizational effectiveness and standards towards the actualization of set goals.</p>
                <p>However, most managers do not really have the basic communication skills/competencies for effective leading and information dissemination. Their inability to acquire the basic communication skills will demoralize organizational standards in the communication system, which will definitely crumble workers' efficiencies and productivity. The researcher concluded that communication skills really serve as a tool for effective management and the level of decision-making and goal setting in an organization, which is why it cannot be overlooked.</p>
