            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings are summarized as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That there is a relationship between leadership and employees' performance.</li>
                    <li>That there are no leadership obstacles that hamper employees' performance in the Jos North Local Government Council. However, when this variable was held constant, other factors such as good office equipment, insufficient funds, poor work environment, and others are some of the variables that hamper the performance of the Jos North Local Government Council.</li>
                    <li>That there are possible ways of enhancing employees' performance leadership for effective performance in Jos North Local Government Council. Some of these ways are:</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managing organizations in Nigeria in a way that is consistent with environmental variables, having in mind the culture of the people, their needs, and value preferences.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that for a leader to be effective, they need to possess all the positive qualities which a leader needs for leading well, as stated in the literature review.</li>
                    <li>Needing the support of the head office and that of subordinates to succeed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Organizations are established for specific purposes and objectives. People also join organizations to satisfy their needs, and in doing so, they contribute to employees' performance to achieve the objectives of the organization. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every leader to build an organization that will function effectively. The extent to which they succeed will depend considerably on subordinates' willingness to cooperate with them. Among other things, it will depend on the degree of congruency between the leadership style adopted by the leader and the expectations and desires of the subordinates.</p>
                <p>In view of the above, to realize the objectives of the Jos North Local Government Council, the leadership should be effective enough to recognize the needs of the workers. They should employ appropriate motivational tools, such as promotion of staff based on merit and skills, provide suitable work environments, ensure free flow of information, offer personal recognition, and invest in research and development.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there are possible ways to enhance the Jos North Local Government through the provision of the necessary tools, financial support, office equipment, conducive work environments, and staff motivation.</p>
