            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Chapter one had its main focus on the general introduction of the subject of the study. Questions and objectives of the study were posed in the chapter to help drive the conduct of the research. Other sections of the chapter also highlight one or two necessary facts about the direction and focus of the research work.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter two essentially focused on the review of relevant literatures that share the same aim as the research subject. Several sections were created under this chapter to make a thorough review of important literatures and explain variables related to the topic.</p>
            
                <p>Furthermore, an attempt was made to formulate an important and accurate theoretical framework that best explains the role of pricing policies on consumer goods and services. Theoretical assumptions from different theories were used to drive the research.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter three focused on a very important aspect of good research work, i.e., the methodological perspectives used in the study. It also shed light on the research settings adopted by the study and highlighted the means through which data was generated to enable valid predictions for the study.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter four comprised data analysis and interpretations of the gathered data for the research work and were illustrated in a tabular form, with interpretations made below. Therein, the study concluded that the role of pricing policies on consumer goods and services has a significant impact on the organization and customers.</p>
            
                <p>In this research work, the following conclusions were made:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>The assumptions that most Nigerians always associate high prices with high quality were proven to be true.</li>
                    <li>There is always a negative reaction from people whenever there is a price reduction on Grand Cereal products.</li>
                    <li>There is always a positive reaction from consumers whenever there is a price reduction on Grand Cereals products.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>That pricing policies affect consumer goods. In addition to the above conclusions, most manufacturing companies that produce similar products to that of Grand Cereals should observe the above findings and the suggested recommendations based on the research problem.</p>
