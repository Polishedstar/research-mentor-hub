            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this study was specifically based on finding out the perception of professional health care providers on the factors affecting job performance in Kano State Hospital Management Board, Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>In this study, the overall subject used comprises all two hundred and five [205] professional nurses who worked in Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospitals, managed in the umbrella of Kano State Hospital Management Board during this survey. For the reason that those nurses in the hospital board occupied the majority of the state percentage, when compared to others working at dispersed places around the state or in comparison to private hospitals. It’s observed that the nurses working in the public hospitals are experiencing more work stress and workload as well as public expectations to serve them better than others working in the private owing to their hospital served as the highest referral in the state.</p>
            
                <p>In this study, a standardized Likert scale type questionnaire developed by Awases (2006) was adapted. It’s designed under three (3) sections and harmonized in one single questionnaire, consisting of sixty-three (63) items that were administered to two hundred-five (205) nurses at Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, Kano. Furthermore, the characteristics of a questionnaire are identified as less expensive and cheaper than using other instruments. Numerous respondents can easily be reached within a short amount of time. It reduces travel costs. It also offers an easy way to gather a lot of information within a limited time. Research subjects can complete the questionnaire within the time frame without pressure or speedy responses. Anonymity is always guaranteed, and data analysis in close-ended questions is straightforward with no time wasted (Gillham, 2000).</p>
            
                <p>The descriptive statistical method of data analysis used in this study to show the sample frequencies and percentage. The questionnaire bears a list of options from which the respondents are asked to choose, as linked to their understanding and the problem presented to them. However, the various responses are tabulated into frequencies, mean, and percentages in raw numerical scores by the power of (Microsoft Excel, 2010), and the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS version 17.0) used to show the total responses on each option on the questionnaire items and to observe, compare and identify the presence or absence of factors. However, data is presented using brief analytical discussions included in each core question presented for more clarification of the respondents' responses from various options for each question. Furthermore, similar questions in the questionnaire are merged together in data analysis for better results.</p>
            
                <p>The major findings of this study showed that job performance is affected by several factors that are either deficient or absent. The analytical result shows that skilled development, knowledge, and skills were the significant factors. While poor implementation of performance appraisal, workload and inflexible work schedules, an unsafe working environment, unpleasant remuneration scheme, unsatisfactory fringe benefits, support, and recognition were among other factors affecting the job performance of professional nurses.</p>
