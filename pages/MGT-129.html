            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research work focuses on the impact of employee’s motivation in organizational productivity in Jos electricity distribution company pla (JED), Jos South LG.A.</p>
                <p>The data used for this study were collected through the use of an interview method and a measuring instrument called a questionnaire. The responses collected from the respondents are presented, interpreted, and analyzed using a frequency distribution table. The findings of this study are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a significant impact of employee’s motivation in the organization.</li>
                    <li>93.4% of the respondents were of the view that money is a motivational tool in an organization.</li>
                    <li>83.5% of the respondents agreed that there is an impact of motivation on employees' performance within the organization.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the respondents were of the view that customers are satisfied with the quality of the product and service.</li>
                    <li>56.6% of the respondents were of the view that proper management of the executive reduces costs and increases productivity.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the respondents were of the view that company policy has an effect on employee performance.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the course of the study, various relevant literatures relating to the impact of employee motivation and its impact on employees' performance, especially in Jos Electricity Distribution Company, were revealed. Based on the researcher's findings, it was discovered that the organization has shifted from the old practice of placing more emphasis on high productivity and profit maximization at the expense of customer satisfaction. They now value providing customers with value for their money if they are to survive. By doing so, the survival and growth of the organization are guaranteed.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, an organization that intends to grow must attain and maintain a high level of employee motivation within the organization.</p>
