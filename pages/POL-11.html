            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The principal reason for the research was to investigate policy implementation in public sector organizations. The responsibility for policy implementation generally lies with management at various levels, both in private and public organizations. In this case, the Governor's office in Jos is taken as a case study.</p>
                <p>This section deals with what the researcher intended to find out in the research, as outlined in the aims and objectives of the study, statement of the problem, research questions, and the limitations of the study.</p>
                <p>It then proceeds to review other literature related to the topic, providing a framework and concepts. This means that the research is not the final one of its kind.</p>
                <p>The three instruments and methods used in gathering information include the questionnaire, journals, interviews, and observations. The sources were both primary and secondary sources, which are important in the research.</p>
                <p>Section four purely deals with the presentation of data, its analysis, findings, test analysis, comments on results, and a summary of the analysis and conclusion.</p>
                <p>Management can successfully attain desirable policy implementation if they are able to identify problems associated with it. This could be done through planning or forecasting the future and the proper articulation of both human and material resources. Importantly, they can create purposeful leadership in the public sector or organization. It is observed that effective implementation of policy involves strategic design to achieve maximum benefit.</p>
                <p>Kate and Joness in Egonmwan say that the implementation of policy involves three activities, which include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The organization</li>
                    <li>The interpretation</li>
                    <li>The application of the policy</li>
                </ol>
            <br>
