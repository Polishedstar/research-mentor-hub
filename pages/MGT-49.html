            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The analysis of the data reveals that the research questions asked at the beginning of the study have been successfully answered.</p>
                <p>The demographic data collected stated that; there were more males in the sampled population with 179 of the population representing 52.6%, while 161 of the respondents representing 47.3% were females. From the analysis above we have more males with 52.6% of the sample population. There are more respondents between ages 30-40 years in the sample for this research with 34.4%. The study could affirm that they were more respondents that possess B.Sc as an educational qualification with 38.8%. The study could affirm that they were more respondents with 31.1% as staff of Administration/Personnel department.</p>
                <p>The proposition of this finding is that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>100% indicated that they understood what conflict management is all about.</li>
                    <li>90.8% of the respondents agreed that management of Jos North Local Government had adopted various conflict management skills in curbing conflicts.</li>
                    <li>90.8% of the respondents agreed that management of Jos North Local Government had adopted various conflict management skills in curbing conflicts.</li>
                    <li>89.7% think that when compromising style of conflict management, which refers to both parties getting what they want but not exactly all that they expected, it helps in conflict resolution.</li>
                    <li>86.4% strongly agreed that all key actors in a conflict usually accept resolution when compromising style of conflict management is adopted.</li>
                    <li>87.3% stated that dominating style of conflict management affects employee performance in Jos North local government.</li>
                    <li>92.3% of the respondents are of the view that conflicts may emerge after some time since one party wins and the part goes unsatisfied.</li>
                    <li>91.1% agreed that dominating style involves speedy decision making, and at the end of the process, winners and losers emerge.</li>
                    <li>82.9% asserted that there are negative consequences when the non-adoption of conflict management affects staff performance in Jos North local government council.</li>
                    <li>90.5% agreed that employee performance has increased due to the adoption of various conflict management styles in Jos North local government council.</li>
                    <li>88.2% agreed that the integrating style of conflict management affects employee performance in Jos North local government council.</li>
                    <li>87.3% stated that when integrating style is adopted, parties involved in the conflict come together to discuss and come up with solutions regarding the conflict, and this leads to lasting conflict resolution.</li>
                </ul>
