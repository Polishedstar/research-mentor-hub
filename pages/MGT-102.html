            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of this study, the following facts were discovered in Grand Cereal and Oil Mills Limited, Jos:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grand Cereals and Oil Mills always meet their customer's orders and specifications in terms of delivery and quality.</li>
                    <li>The manufacturing outfit meets its production target.</li>
                    <li>The organization puts great effort into reducing high overhead costs through proper procurement of materials, handling, storage, and processing.</li>
                    <li>The firm has been achieving optimum purchasing and material management, resulting in reduced wastage of materials and minimized idleness of men and machines due to insufficient material flow.</li>
                    <li>The organization mostly attains profit expectations due to efficiencies in the procurement of materials, their handling, storage, and processing.</li>
                    <li>The organization has a standard economic technique for ordering materials, but sometimes orders materials when they are almost out of stock.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The effective application of purchasing and material management in a manufacturing firm cannot be overemphasized. In a manufacturing outfit, the benefits may include a constant flow of materials, alleviating the problems of idle personnel and machines, an increase in customer loyalty and goodwill for consistently meeting their demands and specifications, and a reduction in the costs incurred for materials procurement, handling, and storage.</p>
            
                <p>Finally, as production system technology and customer preferences are dynamic, it is the researcher's view that the findings, recommendations, and factors at work in the past or present may not continue in the future. Purchasing and material management in Grand Cereal and Oil Mills Limited, Jos, as well as other manufacturing firms, must adapt to the rapid changes in the market.</p>
