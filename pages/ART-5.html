        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research findings show that there is a negative relationship between the frequency of Pidgin English use and performance in Standard English language. This indicates that continual usage of Pidgin English affects the academic performance in English of students.</p>
            
                <p>The researcher suggests that necessary policy directions should be instituted to minimize the use of the Pidgin language. To address the declining trend and falling standards of students in terms of Standard English usage, the following recommendations are based on the findings of this study:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>The study found that engagement with some teachers promotes the use of Pidgin English among some students. The researcher recommends that the Ghana Education Service (GES) and various school authorities should intensify their monitoring and evaluation, as well as enhance their teacher's code of ethics. Teachers found speaking to students or among themselves in the presence of students should be severely punished to deter the use of the Pidgin language.</li>
            
                    <li>The cut-off point of grades for prospective students going to all tertiary institutions, especially colleges of education, should be at par with those going to universities. This will ensure that students admitted to teacher training institutions have strong English language skills, improving their communicative competence in the language.</li>
            
                    <li>The study also found that students believe the use of Pidgin English is easier compared to Standard English. To address this, steps should be taken to encourage the reading habit among students at all levels of education in Ghana, especially at the basic school level. Strengthening the reading culture among children from a young age will improve their use of Standard English. The availability of supplementary readers for students to enrich their vocabulary is essential, and the Ghana Education Service's textbook division should resolve the issue of inadequate reading materials in basic schools.</li>
            
                    <li>Teachers should be encouraged to use a child-centered approach in their teaching to create a friendly environment where children are encouraged to explore the use of language. Teachers in primary schools, as well as English language teachers in secondary schools, need to acquire the requisite knowledge of Ghanaian Pidgin and its negative effects when it interferes with English language. This will enable teachers to lay a good foundation for future language learning.</li>
            
                    <li>Policy makers in Ghana should no longer disregard or ignore Pidgin. Addressing this issue is crucial for the educational progress of the future leaders of the country.</li>
