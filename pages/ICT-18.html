            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the result, the researcher has in the first four chapters of the project reviewed and analyzed, management needs to focus on how material and non-material assets of the organization can be utilized and also to maintain a good reputation and human relations both within and outside the organization, which, in the long run, will lead to the survival of the organization.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of factors that influence employees to put in their best toward goal achievement. Such factors should be taken care of by management to retain and maintain cordial relationships with their subordinates at the workplace. Some of these factors include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The level of pay and benefits</li>
                    <li>The perceived fairness of the promotion system within the organization</li>
                    <li>The quality of job satisfaction, leadership, security, and social relationships</li>
                    <li>The job itself (the variety of tasks involved, the interest and challenges the job generates, and the clarity of the work description or requirements)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most important of all is that there should be fairness in all aspects of carrying out responsibility and promotion within workers at the workplace. When co-workers are united, the goals of the organization will be achieved at large, making things easily controlled by management.</p>
