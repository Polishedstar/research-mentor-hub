            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study was carried out to assess the level of job performance of field extension agents in Plateau state, Nigeria. The study established the fact that the extension agents. The result also shows that there was a significant difference in the level of job performance of the extension agents. This study found statistical difference in the prioritized performance agents in three zones. The study further shows that certain factors such as motivation through regular payment of salaries and promotion involvement in decision making and career advancement, effective supervision, conducive work environment and annual level of performance among the extension agents in Plateau state. It is therefore concluded that effective performance will occur when factors enhancing the job performance of the extension agents in high and when necessary encouragement are given to the extension agents.</p>
            
                <p>The study shows areas where extension agents in the three zones need relevant job performance in Plateau Central, Poultry feed formulation technique ranked 1st, establishment of on-farm Adaptive research ranked 2nd, construction of piggery ranked 3rd, valve addition to crop product ranked 4th and poultry maintenance technique ranked 5th, poultry feed formulation techniques ranked 1st, first because farmers in this zone engage mostly in poultry farming.</p>
            
                <p>The knowledge of how to produce poultry feed with their local resources is relevant for improved productivity. In Plateau south, construction of piggery ranked 1st, establishment of on-farm adaptive research ranked 2nd, followed by poultry feed formulation techniques, computation of farmers register and selecting instructional materials. In Plateau south construction of piggery ranked first because majority of the farmers in the zone products and market pigs. Establishment of on-farm adaptive research was ranked 1st in Plateau North followed by method and result demonstration formation and organization farmers group and selection of poultry stock.</p>
            
                <p>This finding indicates that the identified needs are very relevant to knowledge and skill required by the extension agents for adequate execution programs as well as responding to farmers need in the various zones. This agrees with Androulitaks and Siardos (2015) that extension agents competence should be in accordance with the task area in which they will be assigned to operate to perform successfully.</p>
