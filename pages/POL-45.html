            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the data presentation and analysis in the previous chapter, the following were discovered:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Insecurity has a negative effect on rural development in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau state.</li>
                    <li>The current security measures put in place for the protection of life and property in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau state are not effective.</li>
                    <li>The incessant Fulani-herdsmen attacks in Jos South LGA have impacted negatively on the safety and well-being of the citizens.</li>
                    <li>Fulani-herdsmen attacks have forced farmers to abandon farms and markets, leading to rising inflation due to disrupted agriculture.</li>
                    <li>The inability of the government to initiate various programs to tackle security challenges across the state has contributed to increasing insecurity in the local government.</li>
                    <li>Government and security agency efforts to curtail insurgency have not been adequate in the nation.</li>
                    <li>The increasing rate of poverty, unemployment, political corruption, and poor government response to insecurity situations are the major causes of insurgency in Jos South Local Government.</li>
                    <li>Most people have been rendered homeless, and farmlands and crops destroyed due to incessant attacks by the insurgency in Jos South LGA.</li>
                    <li>Government must be proactive in dealing with security issues and threats.</li>
