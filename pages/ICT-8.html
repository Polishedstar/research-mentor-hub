        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It is possible to note that most of the workers in the records department are not well experienced since the most experienced has stayed in that place for 5 years based on the findings. A good number of the employees that make much use of the records such as receptionists, records officers, assistants, registry officers, ICT staff, and resource center staff can operate the current technologies used in managing records. However, it's important to note that training needs to be emphasized as technologies keep on changing from time to time.</p>
            
                <p>The findings further show that for the success of the role of ICT in records creation and distribution to be realized, standards must be enforced, and without proper legal frameworks implemented, it is hard to realize the standards.</p>
            
                <h3>To identify the various records kept at Uganda Communication Commission.</h3>
                <p>UCC keeps majorly administrative and legal records. The records include contracts with telecommunication companies and mass media, reports, SIM card registration records to allow phone tracking, just mention but a few.</p>
            
                <p>It is possible to assert that in the findings these records are maintained, updated from time to time to enable the progress of the institution as they act as evidence of the functions of UCC.</p>
            
                <h3>To find out how ICTs have enhanced records creation and distribution.</h3>
                <p>Basing on the findings from the field, it was established that ICT has greatly enhanced records creation and distribution. This is seconded by the existence of many documents created using ICTs. It was further noted that the quality of records created has also been enhanced as minimal errors can be seen.</p>
            
                <p>In relation to distribution, ICT was found to be playing a great role in communication through the use of phones, sharing documents, saving, and sharing records through the use of EDMS. It was also established that ICTs have enhanced security in the distribution of records through ensuring privacy, time-saving, and accuracy. This confirms (Myburgh, 2005) who asserts that the value of the document is often located in the content or information of the document rather than the document itself. With the continued upgrade and updates, it's possible to change the version of the records, but the meaning and content remain intact to serve its purpose.</p>
            
                <h3>To identify the challenges faced by UCC in the use of ICTs in the creation and distribution of information/records</h3>
                <p>Considering the field's findings, especially from the reports at UCC, it is established that the major challenges faced with the use of ICT include unimplemented regulations and policies, lack of proper standards, and customized software to the functions and activities of UCC records.</p>
            
                <p>It's also important to note that though UCC, in collaboration with the Ministry of ICT, is meant to implement the provisions relating to ICT in the legal framework, they seem to be less empowered to make it a reality.</p>
            
                <h3>To propose strategies to solve the challenges associated with the use of information technology in the creation and distribution of records</h3>
                <p>Basing on the findings, the major challenges of records creation and distribution using ICT can be addressed through extensive customization of the legal frameworks. With the transition and advancement, it is of great value to keep evaluating, migrating, and emulating to enable not only distribution but also keeping up-to-date with the existing technologies.</p>
