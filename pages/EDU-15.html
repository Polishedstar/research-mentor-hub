            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Assessment of the impact of principal leadership practices on the academic performance of students in secondary schools in Bogoro Local Government has attracted much attention by educational stakeholders, which led the researcher to undertake a study in secondary schools in Bogoro Local Government Area.</p>
                <p>The study was captured into five chapters. The researcher in chapter one discussed the background of the study, statement of the study, research questions, research hypotheses, objective of the study, basic assumptions, scope and delimitation of the study, significance of the study, limitations of the study, and definition of terms. These concepts were discussed under the following variables: Principal leadership practices and curriculum development, principal leadership and instructional supervision, also principal leadership practice and provision of instructional material, and principal instructional supervision and teacher motivation.</p>
                <p>In chapter two, the review of related literature, the researcher focused on the theoretical framework, concepts of leadership and instructional leadership, curriculum development, instructional supervision, staff development, instructional materials, and teacher motivation.</p>
                <p>The researcher in chapter three focused on the research methodology used. The descriptive survey design was used because of the characteristics involved in the study where the population gathered was too large, from which inferences are made on the whole population. The population of the study comprised 21 schools and 461 teachers in secondary schools in Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi State. A structured questionnaire was adopted to solicit responses from the respondents, using the Likert scale to score. The research instrument was validated by the thesis supervisor and a statistician. A pilot study was used to validate the questionnaire. To test the reliability of the instrument, the test-retest method was adopted. The result of the test showed a reliability in consistency coefficient of 0.92, which is positive. The researcher, with the assistance of a research assistant, administered the instrument, and there was a return of 99% of the instrument. The researcher used descriptive statistics to answer research questions, and parametric statistics were used to test the research hypotheses.</p>
                <p>The findings revealed the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The findings on research question one and hypotheses one indicated that there was a significant relationship between principal leadership practices and curriculum development.</li>
                    <li>The findings on research question two and hypotheses revealed that there is a significant relationship in the opinion of respondents on principal leadership practices and instructional supervision of teachers and students' activities in secondary schools in Bogoro Local Government Area.</li>
                    <li>The finding on research question three and hypothesis three indicated that there was no much significant relationship in the opinion of respondents on principal instructional supervision and staff development and teacher quality.</li>
                    <li>The finding on research question four and hypothesis four indicated that there was no significant relationship between principal leadership practices and the provision of teaching materials to teachers.</li>
                    <li>The finding on research question five and hypothesis five revealed that responses from the opinions of respondents between principal leadership practices and staff motivation were significant.</li>
