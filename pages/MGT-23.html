            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study analyzes the Trends of Naira Exchange Rate. The objectives of the study were to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine the relationship between exchange rate and inflation in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Investigate the effects of exchange rate policy on the Nigerian economy.</li>
                    <li>Determine the relationship between exchange rate and money supply in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Investigate the effects of inflation on the Nigerian economy.</li>
                    <li>Identify the roles of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Nigeria's foreign exchange market.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>Below are the summary of findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increase in the foreign exchange rate leads to cheaper domestic goods. The increase in foreign exchange price raises the inflation rate, and the increase in the price of imported goods increases the cost of production and inflation.</li>
                    <li>Nigeria's economic growth has been directly affected by monetary variables, real exchange rate has a significant impact on real gross domestic product. Nigeria should diversify into agriculture and manufacturing to increase foreign exchange from exports. Exchange rate policy strengthens the economy.</li>
                    <li>Increase in money supply causes inflation, it reduces interest rates.</li>
                    <li>Inflation decreases purchasing power, encourages spending and investing, and weakens the Nigerian Naira.</li>
                    <li>Central Bank of Nigeria preserves the value of the domestic currency, it is responsible for fixing the price of its native currency on FOREX and maintains a favorable external reserves position, ensuring external balance.</li>
