            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <h3>Age of the Respondents</h3>
                <p>The distribution of respondents according to age were as follows; 25-35 years were represented by 25(62.5%), while 36-45 years were 10(25%) and 45 years and above were 5(12.5%). The majority, i.e., 62.5% of the respondents fell within the 25-35 age bracket. These are the young generation pharmacists who are more knowledgeable and form the major determinant of workforce. The finding is consistent with the study conducted in Kaduna (MA’AJI H, et al 2013) and another in Ogun state-southwestern Nigeria (Ismail, .A.S 2012) where 60% and 75% of the respondents namely fell in the same age bracket.</p>
            
                <h3>Level of Education</h3>
                <p>The distributions of the respondents according to the level of education in pharmacy were as follows; 14 (35%) i.e. technicians, had certificates in pharmacy, 21(52%) i.e. technologists, had diplomas while 5(12.5%) i.e. pharmacists, were degree holders. The majority of the respondents, i.e. 52.5%, were pharmaceutical technologists, while pharmacists made only 12.5%. In many parts of the world, pharmacists have played a significant role in the provision of pharmaceutical care services.</p>
            
                <h3>Working Experience</h3>
                <p>In the present study, 2-6 years of working experience was represented by 23(57.5%), while 7-10 years were 10(25%) and 11-15 years by 7(17.5%). The majority of the respondents were individuals with 2-6 years of experience in the profession, which is important for optimum therapeutic outcome.</p>
            
                <h3>Knowledge of Pharmaceutical Care</h3>
                <p>In this study, 15(37.5%) practitioners described PC as “the responsible provision of medication”, another 15(37.5%) defined PC as “the proper storage of drugs” while 10(25%) described it as the proper management of a pharmacy. The respondents had a knowledge deficit of pharmaceutical care concept with only 37.5% of the respondents correctly describing PC, in line with two studies carried out in Kaduna and Manila, where pharmacists had low perceived level of understanding the concept of pharmaceutical care (Ma’aji et al 2014)(Agaceta et al, 2013).</p>
            
                <h3>Knowledge of PC in Relation to Education</h3>
                <p>The present study showed that 5 out of 5 pharmacists (100%) interviewed had knowledge of PC, 10 out of 21 technologists (47%) and 0 out of 14 technicians (0%) had knowledge of pharmaceutical care. The study found that the pharmacists had the most knowledge of PC as the Kenyan curriculum since 2004 has placed an emphasis on the instruction of PC as the pharmacy profession shifts from a product-focused to a patient-focused profession.</p>
            
                <h3>Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care</h3>
                <p>In the present study, 17 (42.5%) of the respondents implemented one form or another of PC while 23 (57.5%) did not practice pharmaceutical care in any form whatsoever. 57.5% of pharmaceutical practitioners in Nkubu did not carry out any form of pharmaceutical care, which concurs with a similar study in Nigeria where 67% of pharmaceutical practitioners were found not to be carrying out any form of PC in their practice.</p>
            
                <h3>Implementation of PC in Relation to Level of Education</h3>
                <p>This study found out that a majority of pharmacists in Nkubu implemented PC while none of the technicians did. The explanation for this is because of the recent introduction of PC in the curriculum in 2004 at the degree and diploma levels of pharmacy education.</p>
            
                <h3>Forms of PC Implemented</h3>
                <p>Out of the 17 respondents that practiced a form of PC, 6 (15%) did patient counseling, 5 (12.5%) took patient medical history, 5 (12.5%) kept patient medical records, 1 (2.5%) consulted with other medics about a patient, 0 (0%) did physical exam nor did a follow-up on patients after drug administration. This study concurs with a study in Nigeria which found out that patient counseling was the major form of PC practiced by pharmaceutical practitioners.</p>
            
                <h3>Barriers to the Implementation of PC</h3>
                <p>In relation to the barriers to the implementation of pharmaceutical care, 15 respondents (37.5%) cited lack of enough space from the poor design of chemists as a barrier to the implementation of PC, 10 (25%) identified a shortage of time as a barrier, 10 (25%) cited lack of relevant training on PC as a barrier while 5 (12.5%) cited lack of the necessary equipment as a barrier. This is in line with studies in China and Nigeria which also listed poor design of chemists, lack of time, and lack of relevant training as barriers to the provision of pharmaceutical care services.</p>
