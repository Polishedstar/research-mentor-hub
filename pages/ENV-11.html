            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The aim of the study is to assess design errors and their impact on construction projects in Abuja, Nigeria, with a view to achieve these specific objectives:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the principal actors responsible for design errors on construction projects.</li>
                    <li>Assess the factors that contribute to design errors on construction projects in Abuja.</li>
                    <li>Assess the effect of design errors on the execution of construction project works.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The findings from the study showed that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A lot of factors were found to be responsible for design errors in construction projects, including unclear scope of work or change in scope of work, time, and inexperience of the designer and inaccuracy of the design documents. 35% of the respondents agreed that the implementation of computer-aided design software lessened the number of design errors. Similarly, 41.7% of the respondents strongly agreed that an unclear scope of work is a major contributing factor to design errors. So also, 36.7% of the respondents agreed that time is a major contributing factor to design errors. Furthermore, 35.8% of the respondents agreed that poor funding is a major contributing factor to design errors, and the majority of the respondents (71.7%) strongly agreed that inexperience of the designer is a major contributing factor to design errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The clients, consultants (designer), and contractors, the consultants' factors are found to be more responsible for design errors in a building construction project. 67.5% of the respondents strongly agreed that the designers are responsible for design errors. This statement also agreed with the research by Chalabi et al., (1987), the contractor responding to the survey stating that "we can build whatever the designer gives us, in spite of the contract, it will only cost more."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In assessing the effect of design error on the activities of project construction works in Nigeria, the majority of the respondents (59.5%) strongly agreed that design errors cause cost overruns in construction projects. This agreed with the research conducted by Kaming et al., (1997), which studied the factors influencing construction time and cost overruns for high-rise projects in Indonesia, and pointed out that the major factors influencing cost overrun were poor contract management, design errors, mistakes, and discrepancies in contract documents, mistakes during construction.
