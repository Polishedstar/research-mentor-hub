            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study attempts to find out how relevant and effective information technology is perceived in quality service delivery to customers and also to examine its effect on insurance companies' performance in Nigeria. However, the study found that in most companies, customers find it difficult to perform vital transactions online without necessarily being present physically at the companies (responses to statement 3 on the questionnaire). This is because many customers have not bought into the idea of the use of IT as a means of reaching their respective insurance companies.</p>
            
                <p>Furthermore, responses from the various companies show that many insurance companies have started relating with their customers via IT networks and have also encouraged customers by reaching out to them through electronic mails, text messages, and the like. The study also found that a good number of the insurance companies are of the opinion that IT has aided their performance levels. This study is consistent with others [such as Hyvonen (2007), Chan et al. (1997), Harris & Katz (1988), among others]; it presents evidence that advances in information systems may have a positive impact on the performance of any business. Findings from this study also gave supporting evidence that greater investments in information technology are perceived as enhancing organizations' profitability level.</p>
            
                <p>Conclusively, this study reveals that Nigerian companies are on the proper path to adopt and effectively use information technology to improve customer service delivery, and this will, in turn, affect firm performance positively. As suggested by these findings, insurance companies in Nigeria can better their customer service delivery process by investing more in information technology, providing IT training facilities to staff from time-to-time, and educating their customers on the need for online transactions to ensure smooth, faster, and quality service. All these would lead to increased profits.</p>
