            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was carried out to assess the impact of market variables in the choice of distribution structure for consumer goods. A survey of some selected products of Grand Cereals Ltd was conducted using questionnaire administration and interviews with some management team members of Grand Cereals Nig Ltd to ascertain the factors that influence their decisions on this issue.</p>
                <p>Chapter one outlines the aim of the study and also spells out the research problem, as well as the significance of the study. Chapter two provides an elaborate literature review of related views of experts in our area of study. Chapter three presents the methodology for the analysis of the data, while chapter four shows the analysis and presentation.</p>
                <p>To guide the study, the following hypotheses were formulated and tested:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>i. There is a relationship between the product characteristics in terms of volume, durability, and user-friendliness and the size of the channel of distribution.</li>
                    <li>ii. The size of the channel of distribution affects the retail price of the product.</li>
                    <li>iii. There is a significant relationship between the promotion needs of the product and the size of the channel of distribution.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The data collected from the sample of stakeholders in this study, ranging from the management team of Grand Cereals Ltd and the major distributors, was presented in a tabular form using percentages and Chi-square to present the data and test the hypotheses, respectively. The study revealed that market variables are essential ingredients in the choice of the size of the channel of distribution, as well as the distribution strategy employed by producers to achieve the channel objectives.</p>
