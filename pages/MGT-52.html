            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study in chapter one gives a background of the study of personal selling and sales volume on consumer goods in an organization. The statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, scope of study, area of study, significance of the study, as well as the definition of terms.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter two of the research work was based on literature works which included related works, empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and conceptual works that explored diverse authoritative literatures from previous and relevant research concerns.</p>
            
                <p>The researcher, in chapter three, used the survey method with the help of a questionnaire to gather data for this research work. In all, 100 respondents were sampled. Fieldwork data were presented and analyzed using tables, frequency counts, percentage ranges, and other statistical methods were adopted for analysis. The hypothesis was tested with the use of chi-square.</p>
            
                <p>The summary, conclusion contributing to knowledge, recommendations, and suggestions for further research were the primary focus of chapter five.</p>
                <p>The following highlights conclude this research work. This research shows that personal selling is the preferred medium that consumers were exposed to, and it also gives a clear perspective that creativity, color, packaging, branding were the most attractive appeals for the consumers towards personal selling.</p>
            
                <p>Also, the research work was able to identify that the product available in town has a medium level of contribution to the total market share and is the commonest for advertising the organization's product.</p>
            
                <p>The aim of this research work has been achieved; one of the research objectives is to identify the most common means of communication between the organization and its customers, as well as knowing the sales volume of consumer goods in the market.</p>
            
                <p>It is also a fact that the organization spends a higher amount of money to reach its goals and objectives. These are revealed in research in NASCO food, which has been able to use effective advertising. However, certain problems have been identified by observation from the performance of the organization, also through responses from the organization staff, as well as from the questions analyzed in the previous chapters, which need to be addressed by the organization to ensure accelerated growth and development.</p>
