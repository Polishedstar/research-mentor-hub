            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In a discussion with a key staff of the company, my attention was drawn to semiotic disobedience, a term that describes the actions of these social media users. Sonia Katyal says, "For this reason, semiotic disobedience represents both an outgrowth of, and a departure from, traditional forms of civil disobedience. However, it differs from classical forms of civil disobedience in three major respects: first, the object of protest is not the law itself, but usually a corporate or advertising target; second, many participants (unlike their predecessors in the Civil Rights Era) actively avoid getting caught by using the mantle of anonymity; and third, it can (though not always) involve the destruction or alteration of tangible property. (Katyal, 2006: 507).</p>
            
                <p>Most companies are likely not to suffer the fate of ECG because the company’s product and services are of much necessity to consumers and rarely leaves them with an alternative. A failure in the provision of electricity delves a weightier impact on all and sundry. Most of all the daily activities carried out by many people are directly or indirectly made possible by the availability of power which the company, the largest and renowned supplier, among a few power supplying companies in the country is responsible for.</p>
            
                <p>My observation of the use of social media by the PR outfit of Electricity Company of Nigeria appears to be passive, in that, the company since the introduction of this phenomenon has been slow to adopting the social media as a crucial communication tool. In the quest to do so, the task of managing the account was assigned to the outfit of Strategic Planning other than the Public Relations outfit which is the outfit with trained personnel on communication to handle external communications.</p>
            
                <p>The regularity of posts on the page clearly paints the impression of a page that is not actively engaging its followers. Given the assessment of the posts by followers on the page, it is evident that many followers do and continue to make inquiries and post their complaints on the page. Activity on the page is dominantly one-sided, primarily because followers on the page continually post and even ask questions without receiving any response from the official account on the page. Parallel to these activities, other users go about posting on the other social media platforms ridiculing the company.</p>
            
                <p>Posts on the page are links redirecting followers to the homepage of the company’s website.</p>
            
                <p>On one occasion, it offered to followers to download the load shedding timetable. Most followers on the page put up complaints seeking answers, but their complaints and questions have been ignored. Interactivity on the page between the company and its publics is absent. It poses as a press agentry model of PR communications where there is a one-way of communication from the company to its publics. There is no form of conversation established by the company with its 3,063 followers on the page since February, 2014 to April, 2015.</p>
            
                <p>My observation about the trend of posts on the page was illuminating; the majority of the posts on the page came under the Enquiry/Complaint category, representing 48% of the total posts sampled. Whereas expected to find more posts in the Shame category seeing the manner in which the company’s image has been dragged into gross ridicule. It was found that in as much as many followers are disgruntled about the service of the company, they also seek to engage in conversation where their concerns and requests will be heard and attended to. In spite of the ridicule, most followers are not out there to just make fun of the company. They want a serious dialogue that will relieve them of their energy challenge.</p>
            
                <p>There has been the creation of a customer call center (Figure 4.4) to attend to the questions and inquiries of customers. However, little can be said of the use of social media to serve a similar purpose. The creation of a social media account is the indication that an individual or company is willing and ready to interact with other account holders. For a company, there is no other reason than to stay connected with your publics and thus, remaining interactive with its social media publics.</p>
