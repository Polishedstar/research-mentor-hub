            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The summary of findings centers on the underdeveloped nature of the rural areas, which has become a catastrophe for them. This situation has caught the attention of the government, urging them to initiate efforts to find possible means to ameliorate the situation and make rural areas more developed, similar to their urban counterparts. The findings indicate that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Majority of the people strongly support the development of rural areas.</li>
                    <li>There is a portion of the population that disagrees with the idea of rural development.</li>
                    <li>A smaller portion of the population remains neutral on the issue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While migration is inevitable in human existence, its impact is more significant on rural dwellers, as they constitute the dominant lower class in society compared to urban dwellers who form the least upper class. Due to the imbalance in this relationship and the hardships faced by rural areas, there is a pressing need for the government to take action to alleviate the suffering of the rural population.</p>
