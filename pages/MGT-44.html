            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The researcher set out with the primary aim of finding out the small-scale business as a tool for the role in employment generation in Jos South Local Government Area.</p>
                <p>It was discovered that small-scale business has a direct bearing on employment due to the important role it plays in the utilization of both human and material resources, providing employment opportunities, and improving the quality of life of the entire rural area.</p>
                <p>Small-scale businesses also face a lot of problems which significantly affect their ability to achieve their aims and objectives. Some of these problems include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electricity</li>
                    <li>Good drinking water</li>
                    <li>Communication network</li>
                    <li>Government programs such as the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), Agricultural Development Project (ADPS), Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NER FUND), Butter Life Programmes (BLP), to name a few. These programs have been put in place at various times to address unemployment in small-scale businesses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite the introduction of all these programs by the government at various times, much more still needs to be done to ensure their effective implementation, as there are no adequate channels for the implementation stage. Most of the responses obtained from those operating small-scale businesses are the lifeblood of the populace in the Local Government Area.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the growth of small businesses in Jos South Local Government Area will depend on the following factors:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The development of infrastructure, such as good network accessibility roads, availability of markets, and stores.</li>
                    <li>Investment opportunities, which may not naturally come because of the factors mentioned above.</li>
                    <li>Granting of loans.</li>
                    <li>Mass orientation and mobilization. The Local Government can organize workshops for small-scale business operators to facilitate the adoption of modern business techniques.</li>
                </ol>
