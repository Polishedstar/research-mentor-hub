            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Population growth, poverty, economic recession, and rural-urban migration are some of the contributing factors of unemployment and youth restiveness in Jos South Local Government.</li>
                    <li>Unemployment threatens the security of Nigeria, as the level of unemployment among the youth leads to activities such as prostitution, thuggery, hooliganism, pick-pocketing, drug addiction and peddling, armed robbery, or even hired killers. These issues can be exploited by politicians to achieve their goals.</li>
                    <li>Unemployment and insecurity affect the socio-economic and political development of Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>The policies and organizations put in place to solve the problems of youth unemployment have not achieved success.</li>
                    <li>The Local Government has not succeeded in providing employment opportunities for the teeming youth of Jos South Local Government.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Unemployment is seen as a contributing factor to youth restiveness. The failure of the government to create jobs has been responsible for a number of social vices, including youth restiveness, hostage-taking, armed robbery, prostitution, and subsequent problems of development such as poverty and inequality. Unemployment is a serious factor in Nigeria's development. The consequences of a defective social structure emerge from the incapacity of the economic system to adjust itself to the growing requirements of the mounting labor force. It is, therefore, the duty of the government to create solutions to the problems of unemployment and youth restiveness in Nigeria.</p>
