            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research has been able to establish the fact that there is a need for a faculty of architecture in the University of Ibadan, which is in line with NUC and ARCON directive to convert all the department of architecture into a faculty. The proposed Faculty of Architecture addresses the diverse changing conditions such as social, cultural, economic, and technological changes in the society in their curriculum. Architectural education is all about guiding and equipping students to solve the problems associated with designing and building in the society which they will face after graduation.</p>
                <p>In this research, several architecture sustainability principles were reviewed and discussed with reference to their design implications and architectural interventions. The continuing increase of energy consumption suggests a more profound examination of the urban environment and the impact on buildings, as well as an extended exploration of sustainable architecture principles. Appropriate research should aim at better understanding micro-climates around buildings and to understand and describe comfort requirements under transient conditions during the heat period.</p>
                <p>Studies have shown that the application of architecture sustainability principles in buildings may reduce their energy consumption up to 50% - 60%. Generally, concern for energy consumption is only marginal in the majority of architectural design practices, even in the developed countries. Energy-efficient building design should be the first aim of any building designer because, in most cases, it is a relatively low-cost exercise that will lead to savings in the capital and running costs of the building.</p>
