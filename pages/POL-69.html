            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>After evaluating the working hypothesis from the raw data gathered through questionnaires, the researcher concludes as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>While the awareness level of poverty eradication and her programmes are quite okay, the implementation level remains very minimal.</li>
                    <li>Just very few persons are beneficiaries from the activities of N-power.</li>
                    <li>N-power, just like previous poverty eradication programmes in Nigeria, has encountered a lot of avoidable problems in the course of policy designing and implementation. This is to show that these problems are not inherent. These problems could be avoided if the recommendations proffered by the researcher are adhered to judiciously. Many of the government programmes have not achieved the desired results with the main reason being that the poverty programmes were not well focused, the poor were not well targeted and also the non-involvement of the people for whom these programmes were designed.</li>
                    <li>From the findings, it was seen clearly that poverty reduction among youths has had no significant impact on poverty eradication in Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>The embarrassing paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in Nigeria suggests the compelling need for a single-minded pursuit of the objective of poverty reduction and its eventual elimination. To this end, there is the need for an agreed poverty reduction agenda that can be used by all stakeholders – Federal Government, State Government, Local Governments, NGOs, and the International Donor Community. There is also the need for strong political commitment to the poverty reduction goal, as well as a depoliticization of poverty alleviation programmes and projects. Very importantly, in order to make a meaningful dent on poverty, it is crucial for poverty reduction programmes and measures to be implemented within the framework of rapid broad-based economic growth with equity, controlled population growth, sound economic management, and good governance, among others. Finally, it is important to give expression to poverty alleviation objectives in national development plans with the strategies and measures integrated into the country’s overall development/policy management framework.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The study found that the major activities of N-Power programmes towards Poverty alleviation in Plateau State include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>N-Power Teach</li>
                    <li>N-Power Build</li>
                    <li>N-Power Creative</li>
                    <li>N-Power Agro</li>
                    <li>N-Power Tech Software</li>
                    <li>N-Power Taxis</li>
                    <li>N-Power Health</li>
                    <li>N-Power Tech Hardware</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The study found that N-Power programmes generate empowerment for the youths in Plateau State.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that there were more males (63.5%) than females (36.5 %) involved in N-Power Programmes in the study areas of Plateau State. This implies that the males are more empowered than females. It is noteworthy to state that gender, cultural, and religious considerations militate against the participation of some females in key activities of N-Power Programmes.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that N-Power Programmes beneficiaries are mainly university and polytechnic graduates.</p>
                <p>The study found that the major factors affecting the implementation of N-Power programmes towards poverty alleviation in Plateau State include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insufficient information</li>
                    <li>Non-payment of stipends to participants as at when due</li>
                    <li>Bribery and corruption</li>
                    <li>Wrong bank verification number (BVN)</li>
                    <li>Overbearing hands of politicians in the programme</li>
                    <li>High transportation fare paid by the participants to work</li>
                    <li>Website and internet hiccups</li>
                    <li>Poor funding of the programme</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Youth empowerment and poverty alleviation programmes in Nigeria have been on the increase because there is a need to encourage the youths to come out of crime-related activities in the country.</p>
                <p>N-Power is one of the youth empowerment programs that have elicited remarkable impact in addressing youth unemployment in Nigeria. From the test of the hypotheses, it is evident that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a significant relationship between N-Power programs and poverty alleviation in Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>There is a significant relationship between N-Power programs and empowerment of the youths in Plateau State.</li>
                </ol>
