            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This report has underscored that the aim of training and manpower productivity might not directly lead to improved job performance.</p>
                <p>Further study is required to ascertain the conditions within which training and manpower productivity could improve job performance amongst civil servants. Therefore, training and manpower productivity is a systematic planned effort to transform through exposure to selected learning processes and experiences, the behavior, institutional conception, orientation, goals perception, and work attitudes of workers.</p>
                <p>The analysis conducted above revealed that training and manpower productivity play a significant role in the general performance of staff in banks in Nigeria. This is because trained employees will be able to translate their improved human capital into improved organizational performance. Our respondents have overwhelmingly stated that increasing the knowledge and skills of an employee will positively affect their basic duties.</p>
                <p>The results of this study have implications for dynamic policy formulation for human capital development in Nigeria.</p>
