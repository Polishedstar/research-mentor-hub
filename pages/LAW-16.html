            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Most persons do not even know that they have a constitutional right to defend themselves personally, in any civil or criminal matter. Section 36(6)(c) of the Constitution entitles an accused person to defend himself in person or by legal practitioners of his own choice. This means that the defendant could elect to be his own lawyer throughout the trial. In more developed societies in the west, private persons represent themselves. However, representing oneself entails a good and working knowledge of the law which most Nigerians are lacking. Of course, in a society as ours, one would usually prefer the professionalism, dexterity, and expertise of a trial lawyer; thus, an accused also has the right to retain Counsel. That is, a right to be represented by a lawyer. It is noteworthy that if an accused hires a foreign lawyer, the lawyer will be subject to the requirements for practicing in Nigeria and immigration rules. See Awolowo v. Federal Minister of Internal Affairs (1962) L.L.R. 177. Also, where an accused has no money to hire a lawyer, the government shall provide a lawyer for him under the Legal Aid Act.</p>            
                <p>Under the Nigerian criminal justice, the constitutional right of an accused person is enshrined in Section 35 and 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999. Such rights include, the right to be informed promptly in the language that he understands, the details and nature of the offense of the accused, the right to be given adequate time to prepare his defense, the right to defend himself in person or by a legal practitioner of his own choice, the right to have an interpreter free of charge if he does not understand the language of the court.</p>
            
                <p>Every accused person has a right to call witnesses in his defense and also to cross-examine the witnesses of the prosecution, the right to have a record of the proceeding within seven days of the conclusion of the case, the right to remain silent during the trial, the right not to be tried and convicted twice for the same offense, the right to be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty and the right not to be charged for an unwritten offense.</p>
            
                <p>All these rights are aimed at ensuring that an accused person is not unjustly dealt with. An accused is entitled to bail and the right to fair hearing as guaranteed under section 36(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This right is very important because failure to comply with the provisions of the Constitution will lead to a miscarriage of justice which will be overturned on appeal.</p>
            
                <p>The accused has the right to the dignity of the human person and this constitutional right covers torture by the police. The police do not have the right to torture any person, as the Constitution confers the right of dignity of the human person on every Nigerian. Unfortunately, police officers often torture people into confessing, and some end up confessing to a crime they didnâ€™t commit just to stop the torture. Any confession gotten through threats, promises, or torture will be disregarded in evidence.</p>
            
                <p>Therefore, the police must follow the proper procedure in extracting confessional statements. An accused has a right to be tried for an offense known to the law; for example, adultery, which is not a crime in law, hence, trying a person for adultery is an infringement of his fundamental human rights.</p>
            
                <p>Under the Nigerian criminal justice, the constitutional right of an accused person is enshrined in Section 35 and 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999. Such rights include, the right to be informed promptly in the language that he understands, the details and nature of the offense of the accused, the right to be given adequate time to prepare his defense, the right to defend himself in person or by a legal practitioner of his own choice, the right to have an interpreter free of charge if he does not understand the language of the court, the right to have a record of the proceeding kept and the right to have copies of this within seven days of the conclusion of the case, the right to remain silent during the trial, the right not to be tried and convicted twice for the same offense, the right to be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty and the right not to be charged for an unwritten offense. All these rights aimed at ensuring that an accused person is not unjustly dealt with.</p>
            
                <p>Also the relevant provisions in CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT, and the CHILD RIGHT ACT shed more light on the rights of an accused person in criminal trials. The thesis in its totality is channeled toward making sure that Nigerians are fully informed/aware of their rights, especially the accused person and how it could be enforced. This project will not seek to look at the rights generally but most importantly the right of an accused person vis-a-vis the relevant provisions.</p>
            
                <p>It is clear from the foregoing, that notwithstanding that a person is accused of a criminal offense, the Constitution still recognizes and accrues certain rights to him. It is, therefore, an actionable wrong and may be fatal to the criminal prosecution for the Police or any other law enforcement agency to purport to, or to actually infringe on any of these rights. The Police and other law enforcement agencies must, therefore, perform their duties within permissible limits of the law.</p>
