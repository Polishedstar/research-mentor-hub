            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study examined the effects of early marriage on the academic performance of female students in Nigeria. Specifically, the study sought to assess the educational and non-educational effects of early marriage on the academic performance of married female students at Plateau State Polytechnic Barkin Ladi (Jos campus).</p>
                <p>The study adopted the purposive sampling technique to select 225 students across different academic levels and departments. A well-constructed questionnaire was developed to supply information on the subject matter, and the data collected were subjected to the statistical method of descriptive statistics. The chi-squared technique was employed to test the stated hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level. Findings from the study revealed that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>13 (7.1%) of the respondents are in ND1; 25 (13.7%) are in ND2, 67 (36.6%) are in HND1, 74 (40.4%) are in HND2.</li>
                    <li>Based on class division; 32 (17.5%) of the respondents are in pass, 64 (35.0%) are in lower credit; 73 (39.9%) are in upper credit, and 14 (7.7%) are in distinction.</li>
                    <li>Based on years in marriage, 83 (45.4%) of the respondents have spent between 1-3 years; 63 (34.4%) have spent between 4-6 years; 27 (14.8%) have spent 7-10 years, and 10 (5.5%) have spent above 10 years.</li>
                    <li>Poverty, unwanted pregnancy, religious injunctions, avoidance of shame and disgrace, parental pressure to avoid sexual relations outside marriage, financial challenges, prestige, limited education, limited job opportunities, and customs and traditions are the principal reasons for early marriage in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Early marriage has significant educational effects on respondents' academic achievement in terms of lack of concentration in class, poor class attendance, paucity of time to read and study, poor performance in tests and examinations, and difficulties to comprehend what is taught in class, among others.</li>
                    <li>Early marriage also has significant non-educational effects on respondents' academic achievement in terms of increased stress, increased frustration, emotional imbalance, widened burden of responsibilities, and low self-concept, among others.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Early marriage is the marriage of children and adolescents below the age of eighteen (18). Early marriage is pervasive in the Northern region of Nigeria. Early marriage is equally the violation of fundamental human rights since it lacks the consent of those adolescents to proceed into their 'forced marriage'. Early marriage has a tremendous impact on the physical, emotional, intellectual, and psychological set-up of those adolescents. Early marriage equally has the capacity to dash away the educational aspirations and personal development of adolescents, which subjects those adolescents to eternal domestic and sexual subservience.</p>
                <p>The chief cause of early marriage in Nigeria is poverty. Young mothers with no decision-making powers, restricted mobility, and no economic resources are likely to transmit the vulnerability of poverty to their kids. Therefore, early marriage directly compounds the feminization of poverty and intergenerational poverty. Early marriage has significant educational and non-educational effects on the academic achievements of its victims.</p>
