            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It has been observed that while pupils aim at such prestigious occupations when still in primary school, it has not been possible for many to achieve their aims for one reason or the other. Such reasons often include, among others, poor academic performance, poor choice of subjects for the school certificate examination, lack of financial support to pursue their education, which makes it impossible for such boys and girls to get their required training that would qualify them for the jobs of their choice.</p>
                <p>Also, lack of sufficient information about different jobs, the course of study, as well as other activities are among such reasons pupils are thus unable to judge whether they would like all that their choices actually entail. Many people are then left with no definite career satisfaction. One can, therefore, conclude that while students do not feel environmental factors are important, they did not show outright disregard for them. There is some interest, just not significant interest. I believe that students do listen to the people around them; and that those people are going to have similar, not significant ideas.</p>
                <p>The pupil may unknowingly define their thinking based on the ideas and suggestions of the people in their support group. Pupils show their awareness of the economic issues and some solutions or answers by the way they responded to these questions. Since the career process is ever evolving, it is important for pupils to learn what their opportunities are, capitalize on them, and then move on. When it comes to predictive costs versus benefits of education, this is where students can make a mistake either overestimating or underestimating their economic situations. Pupils should not confine themselves to just one opportunity, nor should they stop trying if the possible opportunity dries up. If the opportunity is not present, they have to make their own opportunities or move on.</p>
                <p>The pupils choosing personality as their most significant career choice factor, and then, definitely making a career choice because they did a career choice on their own lend credence to what the literature is saying all along. Pupils must know themselves and make their own career choice decision based on that self-confidence in their decision-making process. As far as personality being important in the career choice process, I believe that individuals must know themselves and use that self-knowledge as a tool when making a career choice.</p>
                <p>There are multiple ways to approach our interests; everyone is an individual with their own way of doing things. This brings into the discussion the statement made in the literature that only the pupils can decide what is best for them. Pupils must remember that while there are infinite numbers of resources available for research, they must decide for themselves what works for them. The pupils can use all the tools available but it is the make-up of the pupils' personality, drive, ambition, and creativity that synthesize the effort into success.</p>
