            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the data analyzed in chapter four, the following findings were arrived:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bureaucracy encourages high productivity in the civil service.</li>
                    <li>The Ministry of Finance Jos has good incentives for both superiors and subordinates.</li>
                    <li>Proper communication enhances high productivity in the Ministry of Finance.</li>
                    <li>Bureaucracy leads to efficient service delivery in the Ministry.</li>
                    <li>Delegation of responsibilities enhances employee performance in the Ministry of Finance, Jos, Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>Wage increase is the best way of providing incentives to civil servants.</li>
                    <li>Adherence to rules and regulations improves performance in an organization.</li>
                    <li>Chain of command leads to greater efficiency in the civil service.</li>
                    <li>The performance of staff of the Plateau State Ministry of Finance before the implementation of the new minimum wage was good.</li>
                    <li>Bureaucracy has improved the relationship between staff of the Plateau State Ministry of Finance greatly.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is obvious that the Nigerian Civil Service has contributed much to the performance of the Plateau State Ministry of Finance, Jos, which enabled the institution to perform effectively and efficiently in policy formulation, creating a conducive environment for the Civil Servants to operate.</p>
                <p>Management can successfully attain desirable policy implementation if only they can identify problems facing or associated with it. This could be done through planning or forecasting the future and the proper articulation of both human and material resources, most importantly if they can create a purposeful leadership in the public sector or organization. It is observed that effective implementation of policy has to do with a strategic design to achieve maximum benefit.</p>
                <p>Kate and Joness in Egonmwan say that the implementation of policy involves three activities, including:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The organization</li>
                    <li>The interpretation and</li>
                    <li>The application of the policy.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The research finding has been able to establish a relationship between the staff of Plateau State Ministry of Finance and the Nigerian Civil Service, as shown by the results of this research.</p>
