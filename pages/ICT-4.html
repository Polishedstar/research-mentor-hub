            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this study was to find out the use of ICT facilities by undergraduate students at MZUNI. The conclusion drawn from the data collected and presented is that, students use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in two ways; academic and non-academic purposes. For academic purposes, students use the facilities to search the internet for research information, to prepare for examinations, type and print assignments, and to communicate with fellow students and lecturers.</p>
                
                <p>However, the study revealed some critical factors that affect the utilization of ICTs by undergraduate students at MZUNI. One of the biggest challenges identified in the study is the slow connectivity of the internet, and this should be addressed at the university by improving the available ICT facilities and increasing the speed of the internet. Apart from that, the lack of skills on the part of students was also identified as a problem. Although this is the case, students at MZUNI do train in various courses which lead to ICT skill transfer to use ICT both for learning and in other settings. The obvious reasons for this could be that the skills learned in class are different from what they have acquired, or it might be that after learning, students easily forget what they have learned in class.</p>
