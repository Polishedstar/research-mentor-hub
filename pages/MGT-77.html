            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Publicity is one of the mixes that is used by management of a company to create awareness and persuade consumers about the existence of a new product. The company finds its importance to use publicity to create awareness in order to sell its new products to the consumers so as to attain its goals and objectives. Although the management of Crown Flour Mills uses other promotional mix marketing their products.</p>
                <p>From the finding, it can be deduced that if Crown Flour Mills is always involved in a publicity campaign, it will go a long way in getting the attention of the public who sometimes avoid other forms of promotion.</p>
                <p>As regards to this study, publicity is a vital aspect of business. It helps an individual to behave positively towards the product. The failure of a new product in the market is not always due to the fact that adequate product development has not been put in place, but rather it has to do with the kind of support given to it.</p>
                <p>If an organization lacks the right promotional tools in creating awareness of the product in the mind of its own consumers, it will greatly affect the demand for the product. And also, no matter how good a product is, without the right tools, it will be as good as not introducing it. From the tested hypothesis, it can be seen that publicity is an effective means of new product development and it enhances sales volume as it stimulates patronage.</p>
