            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The secretary can be described in two general senses. First, a secretary is a person who works with another individual to assist in correspondence, paperwork, obtaining information, and handling other confidential matters. Second, a secretary is an employee appointed by a company or organization to handle correspondence and document maintenance, especially those related to the company.</p>
            
                <p>A secretary plays a crucial role and can significantly impact the success of a company's goals or an office's operations. The importance of a secretary's role varies according to the organization or office. In general, the role of a secretary can be summarized as follows:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Importance of the Secretary to Management in the Office</strong></li>
                    <p>Acting as an intermediary for communication and fostering positive relationships for individuals seeking to connect with the principal or supervisor. Providing essential support to fulfill the leader or supervisor's functions, duties, and responsibilities. Serving as a bridge to convey the leader's instructions to subordinates in their job performance.</p>
            
                    <li><strong>The Importance of the Secretary to Employees</strong></li>
                    <p>Advocating for fair policies that apply to employees, including rules related to employee placement based on skills and abilities. Motivating employees to ensure smooth and successful work. Engaging with employees to better understand their needs and desires.</p>
                </ol>
            
                <p>In a hierarchical relationship, the secretary serves as a conduit for information, advice, and feedback from subordinates to leaders.
