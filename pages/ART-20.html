            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>There are no specific verified social media accounts used by the staff and students in the university created by the Information and Publication Unit for the purpose of news dissemination, which makes some staff and students doubt whether some of the information is real. The situation is more disturbing because hackers can easily have access to the accounts, thereby leading to identity theft. Also, it was discovered that the accounts used are created and controlled by admins, who are either staff or students from the various departments in the university. Staff of the Information and Publication Unit need training on how to disseminate news on social media because of the dynamic nature of the medium. Social media facilitates the engagement of organizational members who would not otherwise get in touch across departments, locations, and time zones. In many cases, this type of social media use helps to locate internal expertise and interpretation skills that are critical to make sense of new external knowledge for the organization (Edwin, 2016). The availability of computers and free WiFi internet facilities in the university has greatly helped the university in getting their presence online, which has increased the speed at which staff and students in the university receive news. This affects staff and student awareness levels, enhancing goal attainment.</p>

                <p>The technique used to disseminate news on social media in an organization determines the extent to which such organizations achieve their set goals. The staff and students generally confirmed that, irrespective of their preferred choice of social media, they still receive the news. Virtually most of the social media channels are used, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc. That is, social media facilitates the engagement of organizational members who would not otherwise get in touch across departments, locations, and time zones. In many cases, this type of social media use helps to locate internal expertise and interpretation skills that are critical to make sense of new external knowledge for the organization (Schlagwein & Hu., 2016). It is important that unit heads set goals and devise unique techniques to achieve them. The technique used by the unit was indeed effective since it captured the main target of the unit.</p>

                <p>Goal attainment is very crucial for the head of the department or unit in any organization. The department or unit head's job is to ensure they devise an effective strategy to attain this goal as much as possible. Their involvement is crucial in attaining this set goal. The research findings indicated that staff and students enjoy getting their news stories on social media, but respondents believe that the quality of news needs to be enhanced.</p>
            
                <p>From the data gathered, one of the challenges of the Information and Publication Unit is the fact that internet connectivity has been a significant problem. Thanks to the school administration for the free WiFi provided for them. This intervention has made it possible for them to be constantly on social media. Social media requires constant internet connectivity.</p>
