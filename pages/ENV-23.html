            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the general background to the study and the research design. These include the background to the study, statement of the research problem, objectives of the study, significance of the study, research questions, propositions, methodology, scope and limitations, and plan of work. The chapter, therefore, deals with the design and foundation of the entire study.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter two contains the review of related literature and theoretical framework. The literature review takes stock of related previous works on the impacts of multinational corporations (MNCs) on host economies, with particular emphasis on Third World nations. The previous works reviewed demonstrate the scope and thrust of previous writings on the research field. It was found that as a result of the growing importance of MNCs in the restructuring of the world economy and their increasing impact on national economies, a panoply of literature was generated that throws up a large number of conflicting arguments and positions. Our appreciation of available literature not only sharpened the research focus but also guided our research searchlight to our units of analysis (Julius Berger and Nigerian State). Drawing from the three major perspectives that dominate theoretical discussions in the analysis of international political economy (IPE), the study employs the Global Reach Approach, a variant of the Structuralist perspective of MNCs, as its framework of analysis of the activities of MNCs in IPE.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter three deals with an overview of the Nigerian economy, MNCs' operations in Nigeria, and the foreign investment regimes guiding such operations within the context of the Nigerian economy. The chapter reveals that Nigeria's colonial legacy of integration within the world capitalist system and its rich potentials that make it a major producer of raw materials explain the impetus behind the intrusion of myriad MNCs into the Nigerian economy. In spite of the high presence of foreign investors in the Nigerian economy, the much talked about benefits of foreign direct investment are yet to be seen. The flow of investment into Nigeria is not channeled towards productive use; rather, it is used to supplement consumption, substitute for saving, and devoted to the importation of consumer goods and services at the expense of investment and exports.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter four deals with the overview of the Nigerian construction industry, the profile of Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, and bargaining relations between Nigeria and MNCFs in the construction industry. The study reveals that multinational construction firms, MNCFs, have dominated the Nigerian construction industry to the detriment of the growth of young and upcoming indigenous firms and the overall development of the Nigerian economy. Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, the "Big Daddy" of the Nigerian construction industry, is spearheading this onslaught by MNCFs. The chapter highlights possible options Nigeria can avail itself of, through effective bargaining relations with the MNCFs, to arrest the drift.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter five deals with a summary, conclusion, and recommendations.</p>
            
                <p>Although the forerunners of the modern multinationals began to expand beyond their home countries in significant numbers since the 1860s, it was not until the end of the Second World War that the global expansion of multinational corporations (MNCs) proliferated at a phenomenal rate. While several factors have been proffered as responsible for the genesis of the spread of MNCs into the Third World, of particular significance to this study is the finding that throughout the period of intrusion into the Third World economies by MNCs, two types of foreign investments were prominent. These were extractive industry investment and manufacturing investment. Before World War II, many major MNCs were in extractive and natural resource sectors, including oil producers such as Shell, Exxon, and British Petroleum (BP). After World War II, manufacturing corporations like General Motors (GM), Ford, Siemens, Sony, and Phillips dominated the Third World market. It was only in the later decades of the last quarter of the 20th century that the newest and fastest-growing wave of MNCs began to emerge in the services sector. Nigeria's rich natural endowment and large population positioned her well to play this dual role within the capitalist world system effectively. This conclusion supports proposition number one, which postulates that the intrusion of MNCs into the economies of the Third World and Nigeria in particular is hinged on the desire to plunder and exploit the native people of their mineral and other riches.</p>
            
                <p>With the enormous strength and colossal resource base at their disposal, it is little wonder that MNCs today control two-thirds of world trade in goods and services, especially when these transactions are conducted primarily between rich countries. Yet, the study reveals that the few large powerful MNCs that invested in the Third World had significantly distorted the economies of their host nations. This conclusion confirms proposition number two: although by its pattern foreign direct investment is an activity conducted primarily between developed countries, the few large MNCs that penetrate Third World economies distort the political-economy of small, poor nations.</p>
            
                <p>The construction industry is of vital importance to the national economy as it contributes significantly in terms of employment. However, multinational construction firms in Nigeria have contributed to the infrastructural and industrial development of the country but have not helped the growth of the nation's construction industry, particularly concerning indigenous firms, nor contributed to the overall development of the Nigerian economy. The activities of multinational construction firms in Nigeria lead to the impoverishment of the toiling masses, as resources that could otherwise have been used to cater for their basic needs are drained by the MNCFs through bogus projects. This confirms proposition number three.</p>
            
                <p>Multinational investment in the Third World can have unfortunate consequences for the economic, political, and social development of the less developed countries. However, many of the perceived negative implications of multinational investment are actually either the result of the policies of the Third World countries themselves or an integral part of the development process. The conflict between MNCs and Third World national governments involves the restructuring of relations and the distribution of benefits</p>
