            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study was conducted in Jos South LGA of Plateau state. In this area, maize is an important crop that serves as a source of cash and is used for home consumption. New technologies, including improved varieties, have been introduced by government institutions such as the district agricultural office, agricultural research centers, and other non-governmental organizations. However, the adoption of improved maize varieties, intensity of use, and the perception of farmers for improved maize seed varieties were not well studied in the study area.</p>
            
                <p>The objective of this study was to provide empirical evidence on factors affecting the adoption and intensity of use of improved maize and to identify the farmersâ€™ perception of improved maize varieties compared to local maize varieties. For this study, a total of 189 respondents were interviewed using structured interviews.</p>
            
                <p>The descriptive results show that there was a statistically significant difference between adopters and non-adopters in terms of distance to market, number of oxen owned, TLU (Total Livestock Units), frequency of extension visits, education level of the household, family size. The econometric analysis results show that six variables significantly and positively affect the adoption of improved maize varieties, and five variables significantly and positively affect the intensity of use of improved maize varieties.</p>
