            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study encompasses all aspects of secretarial duties and office procedures, as well as other manpower resources within the organization that contribute to the economic development of the secretary's role in the organization. It focuses on the secretary's abilities and contributions that foster economic development, particularly in relation to their interactions with management and their impact on the organization and society.</p>
            
                <p>The data collected through questionnaires and observations reveal several key findings:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use of Advanced Electronic Equipment</strong></li>
                    <p>The secretary's ability to use the latest electronic equipment and handle complex executive tasks enhances economic growth. Even in the absence of the executive, there is no drop in production rates or delays in operations, as the secretary is competent in dealing with customers, coordinating administrative affairs, and using initiative to address matters that could affect operations.</p>
            
                    <li><strong>Effective Decision-Making</strong></li>
                    <p>The secretary is competent in making decisions that affect price, quality, quantity of production, and customer choices, leading to enhanced production and economic growth.</p>
            
                    <li><strong>Cordial Relationship</strong></li>
                    <p>The secretary's ability to maintain a cordial relationship with executives allows them to make effective use of the secretarial manpower, contributing to the economic development of the organization and society as a whole. The secretary's skills in coordinating activities, writing, transcribing shorthand, typing, using electronic equipment, providing reception services, and fostering internal relationships result in increased production rates and economic development.</p>
