            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Throughout this research work, I have endeavored to look at the different dimension of rural poverty, mostly in the rural area, which has brought about serious problems to the local government. This issue has also had consequences on the social and economic demographics in the rural areas.</p>
                <p>A residual population is believed to be responsible for the absence of the workforce in the rural areas, especially among the youth who are the backbone of work in rural areas, typically between the ages of 18-40. The migration of educated people has left the rural areas with many illiterate individuals.</p>
                <p>From these findings, it is without a doubt that rural areas have been neglected. Even when reasonable and well-planned policies and programs are formulated by the council, they often fail due to certain problems such as corruption and mismanagement, among others.</p>
                <p>The western system of education orients rural dwellers toward urban life and employment rather than staying in the rural areas and pursuing agricultural activities. This has brought about an acute shortage of farm products and manpower in local government areas.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, rural poverty has reached its peak and created serious problems in the country at large, jeopardizing the socio-economic development of the country. It has led to a decrease in agricultural output from many families in the country because the energetic segments have migrated to urban centers.</p>
                <p>Government, which has the responsibility of providing enough employment opportunities and social amenities to rural dwellers, has failed in its responsibilities. This has caused problems for the rural people and the government, leading to pronounced redundancy and a serious increase in crime in society, such as stealing, prostitution, kidnapping, and terrorism, among others. This has made society ill and filled with negative activities.</p>
