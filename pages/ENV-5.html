            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In summary, it is difficult to deny that IDPs have certain needs that are distinct from the general population and which require special attention. What distinguishes the internally displaced are the unique needs and heightened vulnerabilities that arise as a result of forced displacement, including their need for a durable solution. To be sure, IDPs often are a part of a much larger group of persons in need, whether it is civilians caught up in armed conflict or populations affected by a natural disaster.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the objective fact of being displaced implies particular needs and exposes those affected to additional risks. Quite simply, as human rights expert Roberta Cohen has noted: ‘The fact of the matter is that internally displaced persons do have needs that make them different from others in the general population.’</p>
                <p>Seasoned humanitarian practitioner Dennis McNamara, reflecting on his experience of over thirty years working with populations in situations of war and violence, asserts that there is ‘no doubt that the internally displaced have been among the most vulnerable. Not only that, but they also get the least help.’ Countless studies corroborate that IDPs have specific needs.</p>
                <p>It is important to be clear that the purpose of identifying IDPs as a distinct category of concern is not to privilege them over others but rather to ensure that their needs are addressed and their human rights are respected along with those of other persons.</p>
                <p>To suggest that devoting increased attention to protecting the rights of IDPs runs ‘an obvious risk that protection will be limited to that specific category of person, to the detriment of the rest of the population’ is misleading. In situations of armed conflict, for instance, ensuring the protection of IDPs does not disqualify other civilians from the guarantees of protection to which they are entitled under international humanitarian law.</p>
                <p>Generally, focusing on the particular problems of specific groups at risk often will be the best way to ensure that the group is afforded the same protection as others. Tellingly, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement begin, in Principle 1, by affirming that IDPs ‘shall enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms enjoyed by other persons in their country. They shall not be discriminated against in the enjoyment of any rights and freedoms on the ground that they are internally displaced.’</p>
                <p>The principle of equality, however, does not preclude undertaking special measures in the case of a particular group and in fact often will require this. International law therefore prescribes that ‘sometimes treating internally displaced persons differently in order to respond to their specific needs is unavoidable or even justified.’</p>
                <p>Programs that do not heed the distinct protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced will otherwise prove inequitable when it comes to the internally displaced. A recent expert report to the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) echoes this conclusion: “Attention to equity issues inevitably implies that priority be given to identifying and supporting the most marginalized sections of the population in humanitarian crises. Special emphasis needs to be given to IDPs, who form such a large component of the total displaced population and receive so little support and assistance globally”.</p>
                <p>This is not to suggest that the needs of IDPs should be blindly prioritized over the concerns of all others. The principle of impartiality, requiring that aid be distributed on the basis solely of need, remains relevant as the core criterion for humanitarian programming.</p>
                <p>But it also is the case that the internally displaced are likely to be amongst the most vulnerable in any given humanitarian crisis. Awareness from the outset of the heightened vulnerabilities likely to be encountered by IDPs therefore can translate into more effective and efficient humanitarian action. In this regard, the conclusions of a recent study of the humanitarian aid policy of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), which has long held ‘fundamental objections to the identification and treatment of IDPs as a separate group, are noteworthy:</p>
                <p>“The present ECHO policy of targeting on the basis of need will generally lead to assistance being targeted to preconceived categories where these are the groups in greatest need and targeting allows for efficient distribution. It is appropriate to target assistance to a specific category, on the basis of assessments or prima facie evidence, that the category of person is more in need than persons outside that category.</p>
                <p>The special needs of some preconceived categories for protection may make it appropriate for ECHO to continue to fund organizations providing protection to one preconceived category or another”.</p>
                <p>Of course, it often will make sense to address the plight of IDPs through a broader community-based approach. After all, in some cases, there may not be sharp distinctions between the humanitarian needs of IDPs and those of other populations who have not fled but also are in need.</p>
                <p>As rightly has been pointed out, ‘Unless segmentation of assistance by target group is part of an overall approach, it is often the source of tensions between host populations and stigmatized displaced populations.’</p>
