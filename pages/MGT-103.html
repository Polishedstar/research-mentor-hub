            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study investigated the Effect of entrepreneurship on youth empowerment in Jos Metropolis, Plateau State.</p>
                <p>The study was structured into five chapters. Chapter one looked into the background of the study, identified the problems of the study, defined the objectives of the study, presented research questions and hypotheses to guide the investigation. The chapter also highlighted the justification and significance of the study. The research also indicated the scope and identified an operationalized.</p>
                <p>Chapter two dealt with the conceptual framework, theoretical framework, empirical review, and a summary of the literature.</p>
                <p>Chapter three presented the methodology for the study. Essentially, the chapter discussed the design and population of the study. An appropriate sample size was determined and selected using Taro Yamaneâ€™s formula, and data analysis.</p>
                <p>Based on the objectives, the study concludes that entrepreneurship remains one of the most viable tools for youth empowerment and can change the fortune of the Nigerian economy over time.</p>
                <p>It is one of the biggest employers of labor, generating employment for millions of people in various economic activities such as laundry services, poultry farming, phone repairs, and the manufacturing of other industrial products.</p>
                <p>Though the entrepreneurship sector in Jos Metropolis, Plateau State, has not performed impressively when compared to other states like Kano, Lagos, and Anambra (Onitsha), considering the huge entrepreneurship potentials in the state, some of its impacts are felt in economic development, especially in the area of employment generation. This implies that if proper attention is given to the sector, it is capable of reducing unemployment to the barest minimum and generating significant earnings for the country.</p>
                <p>Therefore, to achieve full employment and to become one of the top 20 developed countries in the world, the entrepreneurship sector must be given all the desired attention and support from national, state, and local governments, as well as Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).</p>
