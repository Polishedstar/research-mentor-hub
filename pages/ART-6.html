            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This thesis examines the lighting conventions in contemporary Nigerian theatre as seen in the history of lighting in western theatre and its effects on Nigerian theatre. The study adopts a comparative approach, focusing on two plays: "Saro: The Musical" and "Crystal Slipper."</p>
            
                <p>Chapter Two reviews literature related to lighting design, including modern principles in lighting, contributions of modern lighting practitioners to the world of theatre design, and the Nigerian perspective on modern lighting and its reflection in contemporary theatre.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter Three, titled "Critical Analysis of Saro: The Musical," and Chapter Four, analyzing "Crystal Slipper," present each production's lighting applications, design concepts, and synopses for detailed analysis.</p>
            
                <p>The final chapter, titled "Summary, Observations, Recommendations, Findings, and Areas for Further Research," concludes by emphasizing the importance of adopting new trends in lighting in Nigerian theatre. The advantages of using advanced lighting technologies in Nigeria are seen to outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
