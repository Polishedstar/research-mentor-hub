            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Major findings of the study are summarized as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Firstly, it was discovered that workers' performance is the relationship between conflict management and organizational effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Secondly, the findings revealed that mismanagement and misappropriation are the most common and pervasive types of conflict, and the phenomenon has negatively affected the performance of most civil servants in Jos South local government area.</li>
                    <li>Thirdly, it was discovered that the study provides an understanding of the pro-activeness and effectiveness of anti-graft agencies in tackling the critical problems of conflict in the public service, including the local government councils in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Fourthly, the findings revealed that the menace of conflict in an organization has affected the performance of the public servants at the local government level, which culminated in low/poor productivity, reduction in government revenue generation, as well as primitive accumulation of wealth.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, it was discovered that the problems of corruption and corrupt practices among personnel of local councils in Nigeria can be effectively tackled by stringent anti-corruption policies and laws, capital punishment sensitization campaigns, as well as strengthening anti-graft institutions. It was also revealed that proper and regular auditing, remuneration, rewards, as well as personnel supervision and discipline can tame the menace of corruption in the local government council and society at large.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Reflective of the manifestations of corruption in the political, social, administrative, and economic life of the Nigerian state is the decaying infrastructure, inadequate medical services, falling standard of education, neglect of the basic/fundamental needs of the people, loss of resources (human and material). Added to the above is the routine roadblock by conventional and mobile police. It could also be seen in the way and manner elections are conducted vis-Ã -vis electoral malpractices either by politicians, political parties, and electoral officials. Administrative bottlenecks that make it expedient for corrupt acts to strive. Inflation of contract sums so that certain groups of individuals or people could be compensated for their assistance before the contract was awarded. Ethnic clandestine and similar biological and primordial relationships are favored.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that bad governance is the bane of national development. In order to break this cycle, accountability and transparency have to be guaranteed, and the people have to be involved in issues that affect their lives and immediate environment. Transparency and accountability in governance will help to increase the sense of national community.</p>
