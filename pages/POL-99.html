            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In summary, communication and conflict create problems when left unmanaged. From the findings of the study, Bassa LGA and the society at large are left with the issue of conflict to manage. The embracing of diversity of opinions is one of the major ways of conflict management in the organization and the society at large. Subordinate involvement in decision making in an organization by their superiors also helps in conflict management. Conflict can be managed through effective communication, and unresolved conflict can significantly affect the organization's performance. Conflict is a relationship that cannot be completely resolved but only managed. The barrier in communication hinders conflict management because when there is no proper communication, the management of conflict becomes difficult in an organization and the society at large.</p>
                <p>Based on the summary of findings above, conflict is unavoidable in any organization and the society at large. Therefore, conflict can only be managed but not resolved completely. In this regard, in order for Bassa LGA and any organization to perform effectively and continue to achieve its set objectives, conflict management should be a regular activity. Also, as part of conflict management in the organization, subordinate officers should be involved by their superiors in decision making, coupled with positive communication of the right information at the appropriate time for appropriate action to be taken as when due.</p>
