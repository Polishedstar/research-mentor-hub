            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study was designed to evaluate sales promotion as an effective tool for marketing. The following summarizes the key findings as presented by the respondents. The study was guided by specific objectives:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To find out the importance of sales promotion as an effective tool for marketing in Coca Cola Products.</li>
                    <li>The contribution of sales promotion to the sales performance of Coca Cola products.</li>
                    <li>The effect of sales promotion on the sales performance of Coca Cola products.</li>
                    <li>To develop strategies by which these objectives can be minimized and to stimulate interest in the product.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>The findings indicate that sales promotion methods are being used by Coca Cola to elicit responses from target markets and to increase market share. The findings have been systematically summarized to answer the research questions and objectives. The study reveals that sales promotion (73%) was the most used channel with regards to its effect on sales volume, proving that sales promotion is effective for marketing.</p>
            
                <p>Therefore, from the findings, it can be seen that if Coca Cola Products is involved in sales promotion on a regular basis, it will increase the number of buyers and persuade them about production features that cannot be seen through advertisements.</p>
                <p>The findings in this study, as shown in the previous chapter, indicate that sales promotion is vital to Coca Cola Products. First and foremost, it was established that sales promotion has a high influence on sales volume, as it helps individuals to either behave positively or negatively toward a brand.</p>
            
                <p>It is also evident that sales promotion, due to its cost in nature, is still important for the company to allocate its products to the consumers. Therefore, Coca Cola Products should allocate more funds to the sales promotion campaign, as this will lead to double or additional profit. Without effective sales promotion, overall marketing strategy would be severely hampered in its ability to respond to competitive initiatives.</p>
            
                <p>It can be seen that sales promotion is an effective tool and means of increasing sales and profitability for the organization. If sales promotion is well-organized and coordinated, it will control investment for the organization, promote its products, and create awareness among consumers regarding the importance of the product and the benefits derived from using it.</p>
