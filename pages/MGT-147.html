            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This chapter summarizes, concludes and gives recommendations of the research work. This research work seeks to review the impact of conflict on the productivity of an organization. It is aimed at investigating the causes of conflict in an organization like Nasco Group of Companies, how these causes can be tackled to avoid the occurrence of disputes and any other action with negative effects.</p>
                <p>From the research carried out, these findings have been made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a good relationship existing among the workers and management.</li>
                    <li>The researcher also observed that employees in carrying out their routine tasks must encounter conflict with the work in one way or the other, either with the co-workers or with the management.</li>
                    <li>The researcher also noticed that most of the conflicts employees come across in this organization lead to healing of wounds, creation of more challenges, and competitions.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the researcher found out that the manners of which conflict are resolved in this organization have a great effect (positively) on productivity.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on the findings of this research work, one can conclude that conflicts exist in organizations and the methods used in resolving these conflicts have a great effect on productivity.</p>
                <p>From the analysis of the previous chapters of this research work, the researcher was able to find out some problems that the Nasco Group of Companies are faced with. They include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of involving lower management in taking decisions that concern them.</li>
                    <li>Use of inadequate methods of conflict resolution.</li>
                    <li>Machine breakdown.</li>
                    <li>Inadequate and lack of constant supply of raw materials.</li>
                    <li>The relationship existing between management and other employees is not very good.</li>
                </ul>
