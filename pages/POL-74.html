            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the research and findings, the long-standing problem of water supply in Wase local government area of Plateau State has improved. Both the government and the community have considered boreholes and sunk wells to supply water to the people.</p>
                <p>The people contributed money for boreholes, but the money was embezzled, and so the project remains uncompleted. These individuals and communities that sunk wells did that with their own money. To make gains over money, they sell water to people who are not able to sink wells.</p>
                <p>The local government authority has been making an effort with the federal government to provide good and pure water by putting the damaged boreholes in order.</p>
                <p>Now the plan of the people is to call for help from eminent sons and daughters to solve their problems. This has led to continuous development of the community in all facets of life.</p>
                <p>Farmers are well enlightened on how to improve the use of water in farming activities by agriculture extension workers, in order to improve economic development in rural areas and in Nigeria at large.</p>
                <p>The impact of rural water supply development projects on economic development in Nigeria can never be overemphasized in developing countries like Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Water is very important to humans because it plays a significant role in enhancing individual living. It is the hope of the researchers that the solutions or recommendations given at the end of this research would be taken seriously by the government.</p>
                <p>In order to bridge the gap that exists between rural and urban areas, the government, apart from making water available, should provide other amenities as well.</p>
                <p>Although there is an effort from both individuals and organizations in reducing the perennial water shortage and poor quality, their efforts are highly commendable, and others should join the train and emulate them.</p>
