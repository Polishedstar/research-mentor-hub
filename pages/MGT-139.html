            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work was aimed at ascertaining the effects of the distribution structure on the marketing of organizational products, specifically the Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC) Plc, Jos Plant. The following points summarize the findings of the study:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The transportation mode adopted by the Nigerian Bottling Company always meets up with the delivery schedule, i.e., products are delivered at the right time.</li>
                    <li>The cost of distribution does not affect the price of the product to the final consumers. This is the reason why, no matter where the retailer is located, the product is sold at the same price.</li>
                    <li>The location of Nigeria Bottling Company distributor's warehouse has no effect on the marketing of the company's products. Suffice it to say that the distribution structure embarked upon is sufficient to meet the yearning and aspiration of the distributors, irrespective of location.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Drawing from what has been discussed so far, it is clear that the effects of the distribution structure embarked upon by the Nigerian Bottling Company meet the yearnings and aspirations of distributors as well as consumers.</p>
