            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work consists of a table of contents followed by five consecutive chapters. The research work is aimed at finding out the causes and effects of juvenile delinquency in Plateau State, a case study of Jos South Local Government area. The research uses a hypothesis to judge the validity of the problem in the area of study. The researcher designed two hypotheses to provide room for comparative value judgment in finding the information collected for the problem of study. The method used for testing these two hypotheses was by simple percentage judgment.</p>
            
                <p>In the first hypothesis percentage testing, it was found out that fifty-six respondents agreed with the hypothesis, while twenty-two disagreed, which means that the hypothesis stated in (one) is true since the percentage is greater in favor of the hypothesis, but there are other factors that cause juvenile delinquency in the society.</p>
            
                <p>In the second hypothesis percentage testing, the result was that fifty-nine respondents agreed with the hypothesis while nineteen respondents disagreed with the hypothesis, which means that the second hypothesis is not true since it received favor from the respondents.</p>
            
                <p>Through these hypotheses, it is then known that there are other factors that contribute to the causes of juvenile delinquency, such as:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Many houses have defective home discipline. This refers to where the discipline is either too strict or too lenient to train or provide good moral guidance to the child. In the case of strict discipline, the child who gets used to punishment may engage in delinquent acts.</li>
                    <li>In an environment where there is poverty, unemployment, injustice, lack of freedom of speech or movement, inequity in treatment, inadequate instructions, low standards of living, and a struggle for deprivation that cannot satisfy legitimacy, delinquency is likely to be high.</li>
                    <li>The psychological upbringing of a child that is the parent and children's relationship. The child may not relate well with their parents. This causes psychological defects in the child, and unkind treatment by parents prompts children to engage in delinquent acts.</li>
                </ol>
