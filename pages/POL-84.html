            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Having examined all the processes of carrying out the research work, the following summary of findings is presented:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a relationship between revenue generation and socio-economic development.</li>
                    <li>Inadequate revenue generation is a major problem hampering the socio-economic development of Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>The socio-economic condition of Plateau State can be improved through prudent fund management and the establishment of monitoring tax force committees.</li>
                    <li>The major sources of revenue for Plateau State are tax, property tax, tenement rate, and vehicle licenses.</li>
                    <li>The revenue generated in Plateau State is partially sufficient to provide the necessary basic amenities to the general public.</li>
                    <li>Revenue generation in the state can be improved through the selection of competent revenue collectors, procurement of modern communication gadgets, vehicles, motorcycles to assist in revenue collection, an upward review of the share of the federation account, establishment of revenue monitoring committees and task forces, establishment of proper internal controls to curb fraud, and retraining already employed personnel for revenue collection.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on the findings of this research work, the researcher can safely conclude that effective revenue generation will significantly contribute to the socio-economic development of Plateau State.</p>
