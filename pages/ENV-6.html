            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This section draws attention to some consequences arising from the data analyzed in the short and long-term perspectives. The implications for education and the implications for the practice of architecture are subsequently discussed.</p>
                <p>An issue that arose from this research is that most architectural firms played down on the need for the professional firms to develop and follow the worldwide trend of globalization. There was a very low level of globalization, suggesting that most of the architectural firms were still local. There is the need for architectural firms in Nigeria to utilize the opportunity that information technology offers in terms of operating internationally. In addition, the high level of availability and use of information technology facilities, and the varieties of services offered including structural design, construction, project management, and modeling were also found to be important attributes of the successful architectural firms. This suggests the need for architectural firms to better use information technology and open up to the provision of other related services apart from the core architectural firms.</p>
                <p>The study also found the basic characteristics of architectural firms in Nigeria and these findings can be useful for the development of the much-needed strategic plan for the development of the profession. The findings on the responses of the architectural firms to external influences also suggest the areas of internal planning which architectural firms can concentrate on depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the external environment.</p>
                <p>The high level of professionalization suggests there is a need for schools of architecture to further integrate internship as part of the program of study for students. There is also a need to concentrate on competence in design and information technology and AUTOCAD literacy of the students as these were more important criteria in the selection of the staff of the architectural firms than the educational qualification itself. The results also suggest the need for architectural firms to train students of architecture extensively in construction and project management as design and build and project management were more popular project procurement methods that the firms engaged in. The business-related training of architects was also found to be one of the significant determinants of the success of the architectural firms. This suggests that business studies should be integrated into the curriculum of architectural schools in Nigeria to ensure that upcoming architects are thoroughly prepared before they leave school. The need for business training of practicing architects also needs to be addressed through the Continuous Professional Development (CPD) of the Nigerian Institute of Architects.</p>
                <p>The context of practice of architectural firms in Nigeria was established by the study. The findings of the study can thus be used as a basis for the development of a book, which can be used to teach the organization of architectural firms, instead of using foreign practices as examples.</p>
                <p>The architectural firms were found to be different from other organizations. In addition, in terms of the way they competed, the architectural firms were different from the architectural firms in other countries. Most importantly, the typologies suggest that architectural firms are different from one another. Architectural firms can no longer be assumed to be different: they are indeed different. This suggests that architectural firms should further be studied as unique organizations, where assumptions about organizations generally do not hold. This also suggests the need for architectural firms in Nigeria to devise their own ways of running their firms, different from the way architectural firms in other countries are organized.</p>
                <p>The systems approach to the study of architectural firms was also found to be useful, confirming that architectural firms as organizations could also be expected to differ both in their internal structure and in the way that they respond to the external influences. It thus confirms that the ways that the architectural firms were organized were dependent on or contingent on the other factors within and outside the firms. This suggests that more empirical studies on architectural firms, which also adopt the holistic stance of the systems approach, may be useful to investigate further differences and similarities between architectural firms.</p>
