            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Having discussed the findings of the work in chapter four, the summary of the findings would be highlighted as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>That Local Government democracy has influenced poverty reduction in rural areas.</li>
                    <li>That the public office holders at the local government are not often accountable to the people at the local government areas.</li>
                    <li>That Local Government autonomy would be the panacea for rural development and an effective local government system in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>That the problem associated with Local Government democracy and rural transformations is the exclusion of rural populace in decision-making as well as leadership problems, respectively.</li>
                    <li>That Local Government administration in Nigeria is an agent of rural transformation if effective democracy is being practiced.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>For a very long period of time, rural populace constituting about 75% of Nigeria's population have suffered great conditions of want and deprivation. While attempts to effectively improve the socio-economic life of the people continue to fail, there is still high hope from the rural populace that the challenges of corruption, leadership problems, and exclusion of rural populace in decision-making, fatigue of expectation from government's economic transformation change agenda. To break this jinx of failure and for the government to effectively transform rural areas as a catalyst for national development, there is an urgent need for continuous and sustained diversification of rural transformation strategies to enhance efficacy and effectiveness.</p>
