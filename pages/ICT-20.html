            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This particular research work is set out to determine the management policy and its impact on public organizational performance and to find out if adequate attention is given to management policies and public organization performance, especially in NDLEA in Jos.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the research findings shows that the National Drugs Laws Enforcement Agencies (NDLEA) has not adequately achieved all its objectives effectively because of the limited resources at the disposal, not the management. These limited resources include poor funding, unqualified management staff, poor motivation, and lack of modern technology, all of which constitute the factors hindering efficient management of public organization.</p>
                <p>It was also discovered that management policy of public organization performance contributes immensely to the socio-economic development of the nation. Hence, the organization negatively affects performance toward achieving goals by its policies and programs.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the importance of staff motivation was brought to the limelight because motivation boosts the morale of staff to increase work performance.</p>
                <p>Therefore, in a nutshell, management policy and public organization performance involve the management tools which are machinery, money, material, and management itself, which consist of the basis of any functional organization. The success and failure of any organization depend on the effective management and utilization of these resources.</p>
            
                <p>It is a known fact that the basic and rudimentary rationale behind undertaking any research work in an organization is to find out implements hindering the smooth running of that establishment and try to find ways of solving such problems. However, the major aim of this work centers on the effect of management policy and public organizational performance and to suggest possible alternatives for improving organizational efficiency and performance despite problems faced by such an establishment.</p>
                <p>The outcome of the research proves that the management policy NDLEA would contribute to socio-economic development considering the objectives that have been set for the center.</p>
                <p>Also, that human and material resources should be given utmost priority in an establishment as they determine the direction of the organization, whether heading toward success or failure. Therefore, management must by all means ensure that they have adequate material and human resources for the purposeful and general organizational objectives attainment.</p>
