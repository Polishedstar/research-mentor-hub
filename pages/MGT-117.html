            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research focuses on the Impact of Management Objectives on Organizational Performance in First Bank of Nigeria Plc, Jos Branch, which can only be actualized through good performance appraisal, formulating and implementing policies that will yield expected results. The research work also determines the factors that come into play during the management process to ascertain productivity in an organization.</p>
            
                <p>Effective management requires the setting of clear objectives. Without having clear objectives, no group or individual can perform effectively or efficiently. One of the major criteria for setting clear objectives is the scope of measurement. Therefore, objectives should be set in such a way that they provide a clear direction for people to contribute and perform to achieve the same goals.</p>
            
                <p>All types of organizations, including government establishments, non-governmental organizations, etc., require good management to function effectively. Management is universal to all persons, whether of high or low class. Every organization is responsible to certain groups, such as shareholders, customers, employees, members of the public, etc. The survival and prosperity of the organization depend on the accomplishment of its objectives in relation to meeting the needs of these groups. Management, therefore, guides the enterprise in this direction.</p>
            
                <p>The study discovered the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Involvement of employees in setting objectives is ideal to increase organizational performance.</li>
                    <li>Good relationships with management improve the organization's performance.</li>
                    <li>A combination of management and employees understand how management by objectives can be applied.</li>
                    <li>When employees are given the chance to contribute to organizational decision-making, they strive to achieve the goals they have set.</li>
                    <li>Motivation determines employee output of work or performance.</li>
                    <li>Providing promotions when due improves employee and organizational performance.</li>
                    <li>Encouragement from management motivates employees to have a passion for work.</li>
                    <li>Employees' willingness to stay on the job largely depends on the compensation packages of the organization.</li>
                    <li>Organizational performance enables managers to provide a way to integrate and focus the efforts of all organizational members.</li>
                    <li>It enhances understanding of employees on how management by objectives can be applied.</li>
                    <li>It determines the attainment of organizational goals.</li>
                    <li>It serves as a parameter for measuring the success, failure, strengths, and weaknesses of an organization.</li>
                </ul>
