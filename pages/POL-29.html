            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Recent occurrences in Nigeria clearly show that the state of insecurity in the polity has assumed a frightening dimension. While it may be posited that insecurity is a global problem, what looks rather strange in our situation is the seeming inability of our government to tackle the challenge head-long. The clich√© of 'security threat' has almost transformed into 'security collapse'. Boko Haram, Fulani Herdsmen, and gun attacks on innocent Nigerians have become almost a daily routine.</p>
                <p>Recently, the group added another dimension to the campaign. It has started the bombing of school buildings, abduction of secondary school girls, and forcing them into marriage with the members of the sect.</p>
                <p>In all, what we need is a good government. And a good government is possible as long as people who are put in positions of authority are allowed and are committed to discharge their duties without fear or favor; are determined to serve with zeal and patriotism; are not ready to sell out to international capital and are ready to stand by the truth and die for it. In all, there is no mono-cultural theory that is a cure-all to the diverse nature of insecurity in Nigeria, but I believe and stand by the theory that Nigeria should evolve into six regions, each region having its Premier or Governor.</p>
                <p>This research examined the effect of insecurity on the business climate in Plateau State with Jos North as the case study. The theoretical positions on insecurity in relation to the Marxian theory of insecurity, the elite theory of insecurity, and the relative deprivation theory on insecurity were reviewed, and the work was anchored on the relative deprivation theory of insecurity, which identifies poverty, inequality, and unemployment as leading causes of insecurity. Insecurity was identified as a problem facing society, and its effects were analyzed as it affects businesses. The empirical result of the regression confirmed that insecurity has a significant effect on the business climate in Plateau State, revealing the negative relationship between them. This implies that the government has a vital role to play by providing security personnel in Plateau State, especially in areas where insecurity is most pronounced, like Jos North Local Government Area.</p>
