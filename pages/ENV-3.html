            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Overviewing the entire process, several important points can be summarized. In detached houses of the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional link of essential spaces was preserved. However, in contemporary houses, all relationships are re-arranged, and the courtyard disappears, leaving fragmented spaces to preserve some of its activities.</p>
                <p>The only indication suggesting the initial system structure is the adjoining space between the main bedroom and the living room, which appears as a rule in every typical plan. The central lobby emerges as a universal solution for circulation in contemporary houses in Benin, linking the three remaining essential spaces. Circulation has been transposed from the courtyard to the ugha and then to the central lobby or lobbies.</p>
                <p>Through space-activity interactions, the main bedroom is the most activity-depleted space, indicating a change in its traditional meaning as the most important space for the whole family. Notably, the status of the kitchen, toilet, and bathroom has changed, successfully crossing the conceptual boundary between the 'dirty low-level zone' and the 'clean high-level zone'.</p>
                <p>If the oto-eghodo and the ugha were once regarded as two discharges of public activities, then the terrace, ante-room, living room, and dining replace them in contemporary houses.</p>
                <p>One of the most significant changes is the transformation of the courtyard. The multiple roles of this outdoor space have been redistributed into the six newly emerged rooms in the contemporary house. The utility room, balcony, ante-room, lobbies, dining, and laundry have inherited its activities, and the central lobby now serves its function as a circulation core. Interestingly, not only the activities enclosed by the courtyard have been transferred but also the structural concept of the courtyard itself.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the central lobby, which only serves the positional role of the courtyard as a circulation core, these new alternative spaces have all become a clean living zone in the upper level. The mud floor of the traditional house, originally designed for cooling, is now constructed with newer building materials in contemporary houses. The initial function is entirely lost, but the secondary function, the clean-dirty distinction acquired through long practice, has been transferred to contemporary homes.</p>
