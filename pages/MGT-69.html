            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Employees are held to occupy a strategic role in corporate success. It was found that there was a relationship between employees and the performance of the organization. All employees made contributions to the organization according to the duties assigned to them. The company seeks to have well-motivated, trained, and professional employees as it was found that the company employed more professional employees than unprofessional employees. There is a high level of employee turnover because of a lack of motivation, inefficient communication, poor working conditions, and a lack of employee participation.</p>
            
                <h3>Findings on the Level of Organizational Performance for the Last Five Years</h3>
                <p>The organizational performance has increased for the last five years. According to respondents, the performance is a result of a good reputation, increased market share, and a high annual turnover, indicating that performance has improved. Despite the high level of performance, the organization still realizes poor performance due to poor relationships between employees and management.</p>
            
                <h3>Findings on the Relationship Between Employees and Organizational Performance</h3>
                <p>The study findings show that a strong positive correlation exists between employees and organizational performance since r=0.8, indicating that employees have a significant influence on the performance of the organization.</p>
            
                <p>The result from Pearson correlation shows that there is a strong positive relationship between employees and organizational performance. The study findings revealed that poor performance is a result of poor working conditions, a lack of motivation, ineffective communication, and a lack of employee participation. Employee relations have a significant impact on organizational performance; if the relationship is poor, organizational performance will be negatively affected.</p>
