            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>A theoretical background of marketing research as a means of development and satisfying the needs, wants, and aspirations of the potential consumer has been stressed. This leads to the assessment that facilitates the exchange purpose of satisfying human needs.</p>
                <p>Similarly, apart from identifying the limitations of the study, the objective was also stressed. For instance, it was to generally assess the importance of marketing research and its impact on business organization. Conclusions related to the attainment of this objective were also drawn. That was not all. Specific relevant terms that are consistently in use were particularly defined.</p>
                <p>A review of some related literature on various aspects of marketing was carried out. For instance, apart from the background approach to the development of marketing research, steps in conducting marketing research in any business organization were also generally reviewed. This was not all, as research methodology, population, method of data collection were also discussed in chapter three (3). In addition to the actual presentation, interpretation, and analysis of data in chapter (4).</p>
                <p>It was further identified that even though marketing research is the only "sure" way for the survival of business organizations, financial assistance to this very department is sometimes inadequate to undertake a well-understood and successful marketing research.</p>
                <p>It is now evident that truly, marketing research is a life wire of any organization today, even though there are some financial obligations. When it was analyzed and accepted that the role of marketing research cannot be overlooked, it is truly the engine room of any business organization in existence today. Nevertheless, the financial commitments to this particular department or exercise matter.</p>
                <p>These situations, therefore, mean that marketing research cannot be adequately performed in its transitional role of providing management with the desired insights. In other words, the survival of any business organization today depends solidly on the well-being of the marketing research policies of such an organization.</p>
