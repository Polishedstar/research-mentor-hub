        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study findings showed that traditional farming practices in Bassa LGA include mixed farming, intercropping, crop rotation, shifting cultivation, free range for livestock, and agroforestry.</p>
            
                <p>The above findings are in concurrence with NEEMA, which states that rural farmers use a variety of farming techniques according to the topography of the area, season, and culture. It identifies intercropping as a common practice used by rural farmers to increase crop output from their small plots of land due to land shortage (NEEMA report, 2008).</p>
            
                <p>The above findings also agree with Dixon et al. (2009), who argue that subsistence mixed crop and livestock farming systems are commonly practiced in rural areas to provide an opportunity for sustainable increase in agricultural productivity.</p>
            
                <p>On the same issue, Pier (2003) says shifting cultivation is still a main system of traditional farming, especially in areas of low population densities.</p>
            
                <h3>Impact of Farming on the Socioeconomic Status of People</h3>
                <p>Findings from the study revealed that farming has improved the standard of living of people, exemplified by good shelters. Most farmers have been able to send their children to good schools, have enough food and good health, have acquired bicycles, cars, and motorcycles, farmers stage expensive parties, and there is growth of trading centers, including more buildings and diverse businesses attracted by improved people's economic status.</p>
            
                <p>However, Mugerwa (2008) says that notwithstanding the impact of farming, in some communities, traditional farming practices have a tendency of returning low productivity, which results in food insecurity.</p>
            
                <p>Pier (2003) says food insecurity results in the loss of human potential to engage in farming activities, hence reinforcing poverty.</p>
            
                <h3>Challenges Associated with Traditional Farming Practices and Problems Facing Farmers</h3>
                <p>In reference to the research question above, low yields, soil exhaustion, pests, diseases, and discouraging use of fertilizers were pointed out as the challenges associated with traditional farming practices, with statistical figures of 31%, 31%, 23%, and 15%, respectively. Low prices for agricultural produce, poor attitude toward new practices, poor road infrastructure, limited land, and lack of extension services were found to be problems facing farmers.</p>
            
                <p>These findings are in agreement with Waren et al. (2005), who note that with growing pressure on land, farms are becoming smaller. Land ends up being divided and subdivided into tiny strips and plots that are intensively cultivated, yet with unimproved agricultural extension services, rendering them prone to land degradation, a situation that is very common in Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>The findings are also consistent with those of the Nigeria Participatory Poverty Assessment Report (2010), which states that rural farmers lack extension services although they express a desire for them.</p>
            
                <p>Tony (2007) found out that rural farmers in underdeveloped countries often lack equal access to trade markets. Despite attempts to specialize in the production and distribution of certain crops, many subsistence commodities still lack access to open market systems in which the sale or trade of such goods is possible.</p>
            
                <h3>How Problems Affecting Farmers Can Be Mitigated</h3>
                <p>In reference to the study findings on the question above, embracing advisory services, application of fertilizers, promotion of farmer-to-farmer visits, forming farmer marketing groups, provision of extension services by the government, and the government's provision of inputs and technologies at subsidized prices are some of the strategies that were found out to be helpful in mitigating challenges of traditional farming practices and problems affecting farmers.</p>
            
                <p>These findings are consistent with Kisamba (2005), who says there is a need to form farmersâ€™ cooperative groups to enhance them having a group voice to bargain for markets and other requirements from the government. The recommendations from the study are also in line with NAADS (National Agricultural Advisory Services) program introduced in 2001 as one of the pillars of PMA (Plan for Modernization of Agriculture). NAADS was created to redress past shortcomings in the provision of agriculture extension services mainly through increasing farmer access to information, knowledge, and technologies for profitable agricultural production (NAADS, 2002). Also, Maganda (2001) says there is a need to restore the fertility of depleted and degraded land under intensive agriculture and use of organic and mineral fertilizers.</p>
