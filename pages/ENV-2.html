            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It is a well-known fact that architecture is both a technical and creative activity, aiming to provide ideal comfortable living for humans, whether physically or spiritually. In line with the observations and the theoretical aspect of the research, with a focus on single-family postmodern residential buildings as a case study, it becomes evident that there is always a need for an 'appropriate built context' for the continuity of this building typology.</p>
                <p>The findings from this study make it clear that the characteristics of contemporary single-family residential buildings in the northern region have been significantly influenced by Islamic cultures and colonial attitudes. Postmodern architecture, in general, has played a substantial role in shaping the designs of the northern region. This is evident in the data presented in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
                <p>Regarding the built compositional elements, it is obvious that the dual-coded concept of postmodern architecture, as seen in Tables 1, 3, and 4, has been effectively applied in postmodern residential designs of the northern region. This concept not only promotes tradition and history but also covers various other aspects such as aesthetics, creating a pleasing environment, preserving family socio-cultural dimensions and religious values, and providing space for civil practices in the region.</p>
                <p>The study highlights architectural elements in postmodern designs, such as column/arch designs, surface texture, roof styles, and window designs, which reflect the meanings of their origin, place, and belonging. However, some features like door styles and wall surface color and texture are considered less contextual.</p>
                <p>The research reveals that postmodern architecture in northern Nigeria encompasses a variety of stylistic expressions within a framework influenced by its precepts. The physical appearances of postmodern residential buildings, with their classical characters, provide insights into the financial well-being of individuals. Postmodern classicism buildings have been the dominant trend and serve as a foundation for free styles due to their pluralistic and eclectic qualities, while "abstract and figurative classicism" has been less prominent due to the revision of old characters and the reduction of classical features.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the study emphasizes that the characteristics and qualities of colonial designs have significantly influenced postmodern classicism buildings. Postmodern residential buildings in northern Nigeria align with the backdrop of revivalism and regionalism, offering impressive qualities and catering to a wide range of single-family needs.</p>
                <p>Regarding the aspect of privacy in postmodern residential buildings of the north, the study reveals that space units are organized and shaped based on the privacy needs of individuals. Initial traditional privacies have been redeveloped and organized in various ways, though this is influenced by the financial status of individuals. The need for privacy has resulted in diverse plan forms, with irregularity prevailing over modernist styles. Emphasis on visual privacy due to religious and cultural factors has led to inward-looking plans with numerous internal walls containing many openings that allow observation from the inside but not from the outside. In the case of courtyard plans, space organization effectively caters to privacy considerations.</p>
