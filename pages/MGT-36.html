            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>For any business to grow, credit is essential. Lack of credit is a barrier to investment and the growth of income of poor households. Access to credits enhances the adoption of new and more advanced technologies that will enable rural households to expand agricultural and non-agricultural enterprises, which, in turn, improve their income levels and hence help in reducing the incidence of poverty. Capital, as a result of access to credit, also enhances the level of household productivity and physical assets. Rural enterprise requires capital, which is believed to be provided by microfinance institutions.</p>
                <p>Credits to small and medium enterprises have been an important instrument in fostering the development of industrialization and improving the efficiency of the enterprise, as well as expanding productivity. Microfinance banks are institutions formed as companies licensed to carry on the business of providing microfinance services such as collecting savings, providing loans, offering insurance, money transfer services, and other non-financial services that are needed by the poor and micro-enterprises.</p>
                <p>The clients of microfinance banks are typically self-employed low-income entrepreneurs in both urban and rural areas; they include traders, subsistence farmers, street vendors, service providers (hairdressing, motorcycle riders), blacksmiths, and artisans (Wangwe & Wakalare, 2004).</p>
