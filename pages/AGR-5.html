            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The first objective of this study was to determine the influence of socio-cultural factors on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA. Socio-cultural factors were operationalized as values, tradition, and social groups. Majority (88.80%) of small-scale farmers surveyed had poor socio-cultural factors with an average agricultural production of 44.02%, (S = 7.34). Socio-cultural factors were found to have a significant influence on the agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA; (F [1, 78] = 5.11, p = .027), and to account for 4.9% of the variance in the agricultural production of small-scale farmers (R = .248, R2 adj = .049, p = .027). Hence values, tradition, and social groups were determined to have a significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA.</p>
            
                <p>Secondly, this study determined the influence of socio-economic factors on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA. Socio-economic factors were operationalized as income, education, occupation, and wealth. Majority (76.25%) of small-scale farmers surveyed were found to have poor socio-economic factors, with an average agricultural production of 44.08% (S = 7.38). The socio-economic factors of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA were adjudged to be poor. The study found that socio-economic factors had no significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA; (F [1, 78] = 1.85, p = .177). Hence income, education, occupation, and wealth have no significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA.</p>
            
                <p>Lastly, this study assessed the influence of agricultural technology adoption on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA. Agricultural technology adoption was characterized as irrigation system, plows, and knowledge transfer. Majority (63.80%) of small-scale farmers surveyed were found to have poor agricultural technology adoption with an average agricultural production of 42.73% (S = 7.13). Agricultural technology adoption of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA was found to be generally poor. The study established that agricultural technology adoption had a significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA; (F [1, 78] = 11.06, p = .001), and that it accounted for 11.30% of the agricultural production of small-scale farmers (R = .352, R2 adj = .113, p = .001). Hence irrigation system, plows, and knowledge transfer have a significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Bassa LGA.</p>
            
                <p>Therefore, the study established that;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Socio-cultural factors have a significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers of Bassa LGA; F (1, 78) = 5.11, p = .027.</li>
                    <li>Socio-economic status has no significant influences on agricultural production of small-scale farmers of Bassa LGA; F (1, 78) = 1.85, p = .177.</li>
                    <li>Agricultural technology adoption has a significant influence on agricultural production of small-scale farmers of Bassa LGA; F (1, 78) = 11.06, p = .001.</li>
