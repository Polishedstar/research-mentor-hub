            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study sought to investigate the determinants of maize yields among small-scale farmers in Jos South LGA in Plateau State in Nigeria. For a small-scale farmer to realize optimal yields from their farms, the type of seeds and use of organic fertilizer play a major role. In addition, the farming techniques employed including land preparation, intercropping, and crop rotation, harvesting, and storage have an impact on maize yields. Farmer incentives including subsidized inputs, access to credit, and availability of inputs at the right time and near the farms are crucial in boosting yields. Equally important is well-distributed rainfall throughout the crop cycle and favorable temperatures.</p>
            
                <h3>How access to farm inputs determined maize yields among small-scale farmers in Jos South LGA.</h3>
                <p>From the study, 60% of small-scale farmers use certified maize seed whereas 40% do not use certified maize seeds. 33% of respondents agree to use certified maize seeds. 27% of respondents strongly agree to use certified maize seed. 25% disagreed to use certified maize seed. 8% were undecided whereas 7% strongly disagreed to use certified maize seed.</p>
            
                <p>The results show that the number of farmers who use certified maize seed is more than those who use traditional seeds. The results, however, indicate that there is still a large number of farmers who do not use certified maize seeds. The reasons for non-usage of certified maize seed included high unaffordable cost, long distances to distribution centers, past experience with certified seeds which did not yield as per their expectation, delay, and in some instances unavailability of maize seed stocks.</p>
                        
                <h3>How Farming Techniques determined maize yields in Jos South LGA</h3>
                <p>The findings show that 41(11%) of respondents conducted soil acidity and nutrients testing and management. 330(89%) did not conduct soil acid testing and nutrient management. 69% disagreed to have tested the soil acidity and nutrient management of their farms. 20% strongly disagreed to have conducted the tests of both acidity and nutrients of their farms. 11% Agreed to test soil acidity and nutrients of their farms.</p>
            
                <p>The reasons for not adopting the technique of testing soil acid levels and nutrient levels were lack of information, unavailability of soil testing services in the villages near farms, and the cost of the exercise. Consequently, these farmers continued to apply the same variety of fertilizer over years which they admitted was not yielding as per their expectation.</p>
            
                <h3>How Incentives to farmers determined maize yields in Jos South LGA</h3>
                <p>From study findings, 89% of small-scale farmers in Jos South LGA do not benefit from Nigeria Government input subsidizing program. 39% strongly disagreed saying they had not heard of the existence of such a program in their locations. 40% disagreed saying although they had heard of the program, the entry requirements were stringent and they had not succeeded in benefiting from it.</p>
            
                <p>They said the program benefitted the commercial farmers and traders who acquired the inputs for use in their farms or for re-packaging to sell respectively. 8% of small-scale farmers in Jos South LGA agreed to have benefitted from inputs subsidizing program. Majority said they were assisted by program facilitators or were introduced by known influential persons. 5% of respondents were undecided as they did not know what the program was all about.</p>
            
                <h3>How weather conditions determined maize yields in Jos South LGA</h3>
                <p>Table 4.13 shows that 54% of respondents say rainfall has not been reliable. 89 respondents (50%) cited delayed onset where rains set in late in April resulting in late planting. In addition, they said there are lengthier dry spells between the crop cycles which affect grain formation. 53 respondents (30%) of those who agreed that rainfall has not been reliable cited inadequacy and extremely heavy downpours which result in wilting of the crop and crop destruction and soil erosion respectively.</p>
