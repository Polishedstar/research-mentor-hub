            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study attempted to find out whether financing by the Nigerian First bank had an impact on the small and medium scale industrial development. It was a thorough investigation into the disposition of the customers of the (FBN) and support by the bank if it had made any influence on their enterprises.</p>
                <p>The problem of the inability of small and medium scale firms to pledge adequate collateral security also has a significant effect on the bank's attitude towards giving them loans. This results in low patronage by small and medium scale industries and ultimately low growth of the sub-sector.</p>
                <p>Government also has not helped matters because they don't give adequate assistance to small-scale businesses, and many of the industrialists withdraw business money for personal use. All these problems lead to the failure and closure of the small and medium scale industries.</p>
                <p>The study has conclusively revealed that financing definitely has an impact on the development of the small and medium scale industries. Customers rate finance as a major influence in their business activities, and the lack of finance is what leads to low productivity in the sub-sector.</p>
                <p>It can be deduced that the small-scale industries sub-sector has progressively become a major factor in the economic development of Nigeria. Although the industries are beginning to take a more significant place in the development plans and policies of the country.</p>
                <p>This is revealed as the sub-sector is the largest employer of labor and has the economy of scale in producing intermediate raw materials and companies, from which bigger industries can be drawn.</p>
                <p>The customers of the First Bank of Nigeria seem to have a favorable disposition towards financing by the bank. However, due to the rudimentary stage of development banking in Nigeria, customers found out that what was promised is not what is delivered in reality, coupled with the customer's indiscipline, small and medium scale industries still remain at an infant stage.</p>
