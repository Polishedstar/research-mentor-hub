            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Resource development is a process through which staff of an organization acquire skills, abilities, attitudes, and knowledge of their discipline or profession. This has been a welcome idea in most organizations while others see it as a waste of time and funds, thus they prefer employing already trained personnel. There are different ways of acquiring more skills, with the systematic system being one, while others prefer to either send staff on training leaves with pay or without pay.</p>
                <p>The immense importance attached to training and development of staff is so numerous that organizations, whether public or private, have embraced it to help them achieve their set goals. In today's computerized world, it is expected that every organization should send their personnel on training to acquire new knowledge and become more proficient in discharging their duties.</p>
