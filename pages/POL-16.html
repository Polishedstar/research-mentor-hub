            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The researcher discovered that the constitution made provisions for inter-government relations in Nigeria, with the main areas of inter-governmental relations being financial/economic relations and levels of government. These relations interrelate with one another in pursuit of security and other allied matters.</p>
                <p>The researcher further found out that the causes of conflict among the levels of government in Nigeria range from revenue allocation, resource distribution, allocation formula, jurisdictional control to administrative control. It can be seen that local government with few resources cannot raise much revenue and therefore depends on the other tiers of government for development. Resource distribution issues in a federation give rise to conflicts between capacity and equality among the various units that form the federation.</p>
                <p>Due to the inter-governmental relations among the three tiers of government, the federal government and state government have made local government stagnant in its operations and have caused them to carry out their activities slowly.</p>
                <p>From the research, the researcher concluded that local government, due to the power given to it through the constitution, has its own autonomy and share of resource distribution, which helps it develop rapidly. Inter-governmental relations are an inevitable phenomenon in any federal system. As long as the Nigerian federation continues to survive, resource sharing and adjustments will continue to feature as an important fiscal arrangement in the federation, playing a vital role in the operation and structural interplay of federalism.</p>
