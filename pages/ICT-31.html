            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This implies that office technology obviously increases productivity and improves efficiency and accuracy. It should, however, be noted that some of the offices where secretaries indicated non-use do not have the machines and equipment. A few of them do not have the need for such machines and equipment by virtue of the kind of business they do. In a few cases, the secretaries needed to be trained to effectively put the machines and equipment to use.</p>
            
                <p>Based on the findings of the study, it is concluded that many business organizations have computers and other modern office technological gadgets. These technologies increase the productivity of the secretaries in those business organizations. The skills of the secretaries in the use of technological gadgets are portrayed in virtually all aspects of the working environment in a modern business office.</p>
