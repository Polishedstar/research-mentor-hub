            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The indigenes of Jos North can be gainfully employed. Therefore, the standard of living of the people of Jos North local government is very low.</p>
                <p>According to the interview carried out by the researcher on one of the staff of Jos North local government, he was of the view that, though the money is coming both from the statutory allocation and the internally generated revenue, before the revenue gets to the implementation stage, the revenue will be inadequate due to embezzlement of the revenue by top officials.</p>
                <p>Misplaced priorities also hinder the utilization of local government revenue. The revenue allocated and generated by local government is always misplaced and mismanaged. As one of the findings of this study, projects are done not according to or as demanded by the people.</p>
                <p>The researcher also found out that a lack of accountability constitutes a problem for effective utilization of local government revenue, along with poor leadership, corruption, a poor electoral body at the local level, late release of funds from the state government, and inadequate skilled personnel. All these problems hinder the effective utilization of revenue available to local governments.</p>
                <p>After careful study of the data collected and analyzed, the researcher drew the following conclusions:</p>
                <p>That the major problem of the utilization of local government revenue originates from electing corrupt and unqualified personnel who know little or nothing about being a leader or functionaries in the local government. When the head is corrupt, certainly, the whole body follows. When the leaders or chairman of a local government embark on illegal payments in the council without being cautioned, what then becomes of the staff? The overall impact of the problem of effective utilization of available revenue is to say that it has produced underdevelopment, such as the lack of social amenities like good roads, tap water, electricity, and other social infrastructural facilities and poverty.</p>
                <p>The research work has discussed critically and analytically the problems of utilization of revenue at the local government level, examining the problems associated with revenue utilization, the impact, and the solutions to these problems. It is the view of the researcher that if those entrusted with the money of the local government are honest and accountable, possess sound knowledge about revenue, reduce human factors, and possess accurate and reliable information, they will be able to effectively and efficiently manage and utilize revenue at the local government level in such a way that will commend the support and approval of the people and deliver the needed development to where it is most needed.</p>
