            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the findings, it was revealed that the distribution strategy of block industries has a significant effect on the sales volume of blocks. The key findings are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Distribution strategy is effective in their block industry. However, there are limiting factors affecting the operation of distribution strategies in their block industry.</li>
                    <li>The block industry encounters lapses during the distribution of blocks, and the general economic situation in the country affects the distribution strategy in block industries.</li>
                    <li>The distribution strategy used by block industries helps in achieving the objectives of the block industry, and the distribution strategy may have a specific time of operation.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From what has been discussed so far, it is evident that distribution strategy has a significant effect on the sale of products. Therefore, the researcher concludes that the success of Endevpro today is a result of a proper distribution strategy implemented by the company. As such, any manufacturer that wants to succeed in selling its products must excel in its distribution strategy.</p>
