            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study focused on the Prediction of Malignant Cancer Using Support Vector Machine Algorithm. After reviewing the background of the study, literature, research methodology, and data analysis, the following summary of findings was made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Support Vector Machine Algorithm can be used to predict Malignant Cancer.</li>
                    <li>Support Vector Machine Algorithm can predict Malignant Cancer through data analysis used for classification and regression. It offers solutions for both classification and regression problems, performs linear and non-linear classification using the kernel trick, and employs statistical, probabilistic, and optimization techniques to detect patterns in complex data sets, aiding in cancer diagnosis, prognostics, and detection.</li>
                    <li>Life expectancy estimates are attributed to the central value of each age class of diagnosis, such as 47, 52, 57, and 62, or 42, 57, and 72, for patients aged 30 and above.</li>
                    <li>Survivability of cancer patients and cancer recurrence involve predicting patient survivability (1-year or 5-year survival rates), mortality prediction for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and the probability of relapse over a 5-year period for cancer patients.</li>
                    <li>The progression of cancer occurs when it grows, spreads, gets worse, comes out of remission, or experiences recurrence.</li>
                    <li>Clinical management of cancer patients and treatment sensitivity include biomarker/signature discovery, drug discovery for cancer therapy, selection of anticancer drugs, identification of novel cancer drug targets, drug/nondrug classification, and anticancer drug sensitivity prediction.</li>
