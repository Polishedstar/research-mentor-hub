            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research work was carried out on the contribution of entrepreneurship in alleviating youth unemployment in Plateau State, with particular reference to Riyom Local Government Area. Sixty (60) questionnaires were distributed to the workers of Riyom Local Government, and the results received were analyzed.</p>
                <p>From the findings, it is clear that the government has roles to play for the success of entrepreneurship, such as providing financial loans, public enlightenment on entrepreneurship, and provision of social amenities, which can help alleviate youth unemployment in Plateau State and Nigeria as a whole.</p>
                <p>Entrepreneurship, as a venture, involves creating new projects that usually entail financial risks and a commitment of effort or potential loss. Unemployment is prevalent in Plateau State and its associated implications on the populace cannot be ignored, including the decline of agriculture, persistent poverty, social vices, and alarming insecurity.</p>
                <p>The majority of the population consists of youths who are willing to work but unable to find a job. Entrepreneurship is the solution that can transform the society, yet it faces numerous challenges, from the environment to preventing various forms of crime and even the abilities of the entrepreneur themselves.</p>
                <p>The government has a key role to play in ensuring that entrepreneurship addresses the issue of unemployment and increases gainful employment opportunities. It is evident that Plateau State, like other states in the country, faces the challenge of unemployment. Embracing entrepreneurship is the most convenient option to address the issue and utilize its potential in tackling unemployment in the state.</p>
