            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the analysis of the results, the following findings were obtained:</p>
                <p>a. That managerial skill is very essential in any organizational set up because human beings are far from perfect, therefore human efforts and material resources need to be controlled and geared towards the attainment of an organization's set goals.</p>
                <p>b. That there are three managerial skills that must be present in an organization in order to achieve its set goals, which are human, conceptual, and technical skills.</p>
                <p>c. That managerial skill can lead to greater job performance by an organization.</p>
                <p>d. That managerial skill can lead to job performance through qualitative and high production by clear-defined policies, drives procedures, and clear audits, budgets, and special reports compiled by those concerned in the course of doing their jobs.</p>
