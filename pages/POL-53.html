            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focuses on political instability and its effect on project implementation with a case study of Bassa local government. It commences with a background and analysis of instability of government and concepts of policy implementation which relevant literature that have bearings were consulted and also the administration of questionnaires to selected respondents several findings were also as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Political instability has a serious effect on policy implementation. This was proved in chapter 4, table 2, where about 124% of the respondents agree with the statement that the instability of government affects the execution of projects or their implementation. This is so because every government has its own mandate on policy to execute, and the frequent change in the government can pose a serious threat to the completion of set goals or objectives of the day.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on the following and review of interaction, the following conclusions were made:</p>
                <p>Political instability has created a crisis of management and a lack of confidence in government. However, successive reforms for the re-birth of a new local government did not provide a solution to the third tier's problems caused by political instability. Instead, the nation's scarce resources were inefficiently and sometimes wastefully utilized. There was no meaningful and honest effort on the part of leadership to build a united society and a vibrant economy. Consequently, the third tier still faces substantial problems of poverty, underdevelopment, ignorance, disease, and unemployment.</p>
