            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focused on finding whether manpower procurement, development, utilization, and Local Government performance are effective for the staff and management of Jos North Local Government Council. It was discovered that these practices lead to improved productivity in the Local Government through staff motivation, training, and development.</p>
                <p>The research has revealed that, for quite some time, the management of Jos North Local Government has not been effectively managing its workforce. Moreover, it was discovered that personnel selection and training promote effective job performance, as indicated by the 90% agreement among respondents. Inadequate funding of manpower planning has an adverse effect on personnel productivity in the Local Government, with 62.5% agreeing that poor funding is a problem associated with the execution of Local Government principles.</p>
                <p>From the study, it is clear that manpower procurement, development, utilization, and Local Government performance can lead to improved human and material resources management, which should not only enhance staff performance but also encourage accountability in the Local Government.</p>
                <p>However, the problems that have hindered effective human and material resource utilization include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poor motivation</li>
                    <li>Lack of adequate training and development</li>
                </ul>
