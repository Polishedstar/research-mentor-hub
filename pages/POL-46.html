            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The summaries of findings are as follows:</p>
                <p>a. That the need for Local Government autonomy is to enable them to have financial power to carry out their functions that would encourage development at the grassroots. This autonomy will give Jos North Local Government the ability to exercise their mandatory and exclusive roles to bring socio-economic, political, and socio-cultural development to the people of Jos North Local Government.</p>
                <p>b. The changes, in terms of reforms and policies that have resulted in grassroots development in Jos North Local Government, include an increase in revenue base, autonomy, grassroots democracy, and a two-way channel of communication that has increased its revenue base, both internal and external, through effective reform of the Local Government.</p>
                <p>c. Jos North Local Government will increase grassroots development if there is no interference in its activity, which the state government wants to impose their desires upon the Local Government and ignoring the wishes and aspirations of the grassroots.</p>
                <p>d. Local Government autonomy has contributed to grassroots development in Jos North Local Government through sufficient funding, greater administrative control, innovation, and manpower development; 60% of the level of autonomy of Local Governments in the area of managerial control.</p>
                <p>e. The reason why Local Government requires greater autonomy includes the need to have financial control for the execution of Local Government policies and the removal of excessive State Government control of Local Government. The major problems faced by Jos North Local Government in the execution of its grassroots development program are not only poor funding and poor technical know-how. Thus, its inadequate trained manpower, poor funding, etc.</p>
                <p>From the research conducted in Jos North Local Government Area, it can be concluded that Local Government, as the third tier of government, needs some measures of autonomy since it is officially recognized by the constitution. In view of the role Local Government plays in grassroots development in Nigeria, it needs no gain saying that once they are allowed to conduct their own affairs without interference from any quota, rapid development is bound to take place at the grassroots. What this implies is that since Local Government is not completely autonomous, there is the need for constitutional review where Local Government will be given autonomy, especially financially, through this, a significant achievement will be ascertained at the grassroots level.</p>
