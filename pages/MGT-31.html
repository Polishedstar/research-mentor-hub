            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Strategies and policies have been given many definitions, as we have seen in chapter two of this project. These definitions stress issues related to determining the goals and objectives of an organization, adopting courses of action, and allocating the necessary resources to achieve these goals. They serve as guidelines to direct any organization in order to help it achieve its set goals and objectives and improve the performance of employees or workers. Every organization should adopt these systems to achieve results efficiently and effectively. It is generally accepted that for any structure to be effective, it must reflect and be responsive to the realities of both the internal and external environment.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there is a relationship between structural changes and strategy formulation and its effectiveness. Bateman and Zenital identified major areas of organizational changes: Strategy, technology, structure, and people. The information used in the analysis did not just come as a miracle; a lot of effort and means had to be engaged in order to obtain the necessary data. From chapter three of this research, it would be noted that basically two methods of data collection are used. They are the primary and secondary methods.</p>
                <p>The analysis performed in this research work is basically based on the responses obtained from our respondents in the questionnaires, and the information from the respondents serves as a basis for addressing our research questions and hypotheses.</p>
