            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of the study, we presented the phonotactic constraints permissible in the English and Igbo segments, their structures, and their implication on the Igbo learner of English. Optimality theory was adopted as the theoretical framework in this study to account for the phonotactic constraints permissible in the languages and how English constraints are violated by Igbo-English bilinguals in the process of second language acquisition.</p>
            
                <p>Using Labovian's models of passage reading and word listing, the primary data were drawn during an interview section from the speeches of the respondents (Igbo-English bilinguals) who were selected from three secondary schools in Owerri via stratified random sampling methods. The data collected were recorded, transcribed using the International Phonetic Alphabets (IPA), and analyzed using simple percentage format. The secondary data were drawn from documented books, journals, articles, dissertations, etc. and were analyzed using in-depth summaries.</p>
            
                <p>The study is concluded based on the findings as follows: the English phonotactics have no counterpart in Igbo phonotactics. As a result, Igbo-English bilinguals violate the constraints in the English language through deletion, insertion, or substitution of certain segments, resulting in the mispronunciation of English words by the Igbo-English bilinguals.</p>
