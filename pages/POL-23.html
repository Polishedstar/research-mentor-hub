            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study exposed the significant relations between human resource development and organizational productivity in the society, showing the bulky and tedious work of the civil service commission as an agent of manpower development. Looking at the tables and the literature in chapter two of this very report.</p>
                <p>It is also revealing in this study that the procedure used for manpower development is fully connected to the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization. The process of manpower development can cause gaps in productivity and supply poor funding. Manpower development has a relationship that cannot be disconnected from productivity and efficiency.</p>
                <p>From the above findings, it can be concluded that manpower development plays a critical role in ensuring the productivity of the organization. The Civil Service Commission has been a critical agent in the Nigerian civil service in terms of manpower development.</p>
