            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the result obtained from the administered questionnaire and textual reference in chapter four, the following under-mentioned has been discovered:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Job satisfaction describes how content an individual is with his or her job. It is a relatively recent term since in previous centuries the job available to a particular person were often predetermined by the occupation of that person's parent.</li>
                    <li>There are a variety of factors that influence a person's level of job satisfaction. Some of these factors include the level of pay and benefits, the perceived fairness of the promotion system within the organization, the quality of working conditions, leadership and social relationships, the job itself (the variety of tasks involved, the interest and challenge the job generates, and the clarity of the job description or requirements). The happier people are within their job, the more satisfied they are said to be. Job satisfaction is not the same as motivation, although it is clearly linked. Job design aims to enhance job rotation, job enlargement, and job enrichment. Other influences on satisfaction include the management style and culture, employee involvement, empowerment, and autonomous workgroups.</li>
                    <li>Job satisfaction is a very important attribute that is frequently measured by organizations. The most common way of measurement is the use of a rating scale where employees report their reactions to their jobs. Questions relating to pay, work responsibility, variety of tasks, promotional opportunities, the work itself, and the relationship between worker and organization were asked.</li>
                    <li>Job Satisfaction measures one's satisfaction in five facets: Pay, promotions, coworkers, supervision, and the work itself. The scale is simple participation, answering either yes, no, or can't decide in response to whether a given statement accurately describes one's job.</li>
                    <li>The job in general index is an overall measurement of job satisfaction. It is an improvement to the job descriptive index (JDI) because the JDI focuses too much on individual facets and not enough on work satisfaction in general.</li>
