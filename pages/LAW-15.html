            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Over the whole world, rape is increasingly becoming a key problem in the lives of the vulnerable girls and in Nigeria at large due to the factors contributing to its escalation in Plateau state. Therefore, this research has been based on the impact of rape on the life of girl child in Plateau state. It revealed the background of rape and the life of girl child globally as related to the topic of the study and its objectives. Therefore, the researcher found out from the research carried out that the following below are some of the causes of rape, its impact on the life of girl child and strategies of curbing rape in Plateau state.</p>           
                <h3>Causes of Rape:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The socio-economic and cultural factors are the causes of girl child rape. The study revealed that African traditional culture favor boys than girls, and boys are portrayed as breadwinners of the homes. Girls are taught to respect and be submissive to men making them vulnerable to acts of rape.</li>
                    <li>Parents marry off their young daughters before they are 18 years because they want bride price or even when a girl is defiled, parents prefer compensation than prosecution of the offender in courts of law.</li>
                    <li>Limited logistical support is another cause in the form of transport cost to follow up the case, presenting of witnesses, and other necessary financial support needed for police officers, NGO officials, support staff of courts of law.</li>
                    <li>The unwillingness of parents and victims to cooperate with legal institutions like police, NGOs, follow-up of cases in courts of law, the inconsistency in the age of the girl child, intimidation from family members of the offender, sometimes even from people from higher authority, and ignorance of the law is another barrier for the control of rape in Plateau state.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Strategies for Curbing Rape:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The age of consent of the girl should be reduced to 16 years, legislature to amend the law, enact tougher laws which are applicable to the defilers.</li>
                    <li>The fight against corruption from government institutions, police investigation, and court processes should be faster.</li>
                    <li>The community should be a watchdog to wrongdoers by reporting them to authorities.</li>
                    <li>NGOs should sensitize the public more, create income-generating activities to fight poverty.</li>
                    <li>Girls should improve on their dressing codes, avoid men and their gifts, parents should provide necessities to their daughters and guide them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Results of the study also reveal that Nigeria has laws in place that criminalize rape as provided for under Section 129 of the penal code Act Cap 120; however, the citizens' practices have over the years led to increased cases of rape in Nigeria and Plateau state in particular because having a good law that is not translated into good practice or even guard the children against rape is a very big waste since the biggest percentage as shown in the fourth chapter of this dissertation showed that poverty, mass media, urban lifestyle, and technology are the major causes of the increased cases of rape in Plateau state.</p>
                <p>In most communities in Plateau state, children are vulnerable to practices like opting to settle rape cases locally at home without involving the law puts most girl children at a greater risk of being defiled again and again, especially by the rich who can pay their way out, give poor parents money so that they keep quiet about it.</p>
                <p>Literature reviews also that poverty is to blame. In a report by Action for Development (Acfode) reported in the Daily Monitor on August 26, 2005, blamed the increase in rape cases in Nigeria on the high level of poverty, and this has given cyclists, taxi drivers, and video hall operators an opportunity to exploit the situation to defile students in Plateau state. Therefore, the government needs to look beyond just having rape laws in place but also work towards eradicating the aggravating factors so that this crime is curbed down.</p>
