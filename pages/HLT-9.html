            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Upon conducting the study on the socioeconomic and cultural factors of SCD, the results of the study indicate that socioeconomic and cultural factors of SCD contribute to diminished well-being of the 30 participants. Results show that most participants are affected by the amount of money spent on the care for their SCD. Twenty-nine of 30 participants indicated that improved education and awareness as well as financial support could help to better their well-being. Twelve of the 30 participants also mentioned that cultural beliefs have impacted their way of managing their SCD that has led to diminished well-being.</p>
            
                <p>This study is geared towards providing health policy that can encourage better management of SCD patients, increased awareness, and treatment of SCD that influences better well-being among the 30 participants with SCD. With SCD awareness, community members surrounding participants of the study can gain a better understanding of SCD to help minimize stigmatization and lack of social activity among peers of the participants with SCD. Organizations can also be aware of how to provide adequate care for those living with SCD, all while promoting initiatives and programs in their favor.</p>
            
                <p>Overall, this study has bridged the knowledge gap on SCD and well-being in Nigeria. Upon the conclusion of this study, I have been able to gather empirical evidence as to the effects of SCD amongst those who live with it and to help guide in making better decisions in the management of SCD. This can be used from a personal care standpoint and also from a public health management perspective. With the understanding gained from the study about the most common challenges faced by individuals living with SCD and misconceptions amongst the general population about the disease, the populace can be better educated about the disease and help tailor more specific responses to the management of the disease and improving the well-being of those living with SCD.</p>
