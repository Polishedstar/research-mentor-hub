            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>An attempt has been made to critically examine the effect of distribution strategies and organizational sales volume, following the necessity for manufacturing organization to penetrate the mass consumer market and their efforts to respond adequately to demand placed on them by consumers.</p>
                <p>However, data has been collected, presented and analyzed, while various related literatures have been reviewed. To this end it has been revealed that distribution strategies influence sales volume. The implication, therefore, is that organizations must be willing to commit itself both financially and otherwise to be able to generate a high rate of sales.</p>
                <p>It is also obvious that improper planning of distribution may lead to conflict amongst the intermediaries, low sales, and loss of potential opportunities.</p>
