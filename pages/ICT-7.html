            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study sought to establish whether KPLC has fully adopted ICT systems in all its business operations. Majority of the respondents 57.6% responded in agreement that the company has fully computerized its activities while 42.4% were of contrary and that there is still need to fully automate KPLC services. The following areas were cited to require proper automation to improve on service delivery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Application for electricity connections</li>
                    <li>Automation at low-level voltage lines</li>
                    <li>E-procurement</li>
                    <li>CCTV surveillance in remote areas</li>
                    <li>Detection of power outages</li>
                    <li>Emergency operation and monitoring</li>
                    <li>Online querying of bills and payment history</li>
                    <li>Record management and payments</li>
                    <li>Processing of loans, leave, petty cash, advances, and accounting processes</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>In regard to the impact of ICT on business operations, it was found that ICT has brought positive impact on business achievements at KPLC, 293(78.6%), and that ICT systems have eased working procedures, 80(21.4%). More so, ICT adoption has to a great extent improved service delivery, 247(65.2%), very great extent 86(22.7%), and moderate extent 46(12.1%).</p>
            
                <p>On determining the impact of ICT on service delivery, findings showed that IT systems have provided reliable service delivery (Mean = 4.1, Std. dev = 0.8), and that ICT has facilitated effective access to services, timely delivery of the same services (Mean = 4.0, Std. dev = 0.8); again respondents felt that ICT systems have led to improved quality of service and provided effective means of communication within KPLC (Mean = 4.1, Std. dev = 0.8).</p>
            
                <p>More so, it was found that ICT systems provide convenient customer feedback (Mean = 3.8, Std. dev = 1.0), and that it has reduced congestion, boosted staff morale, and facilitated decision making at higher levels of management (Mean = 3.5, Std. dev = 0.9). In general, it was established that ICT adoption has had a positive impact on the delivery of services at KPLC (Mean = 3.8, Std. dev = 0.9).</p>
            
                <p>One other objective of this study was to establish factors hindering the use of ICT systems at KPLC. In this regard, it was found that the majority of the users 78.9% experience challenges while using ICT systems, and only 21.1% are much comfortable with ICT systems used at KPLC. It was established that system failures are a challenge in the use of ICT systems (Mean = 3.8, Std. dev = 1.0), and that the lack of training to users has posed a challenge (Mean = 3.6, Std. dev = 1.3); again it was asserted that unstable infrastructure poses a challenge in the use of ICT systems (Mean = 3.5, Std. dev = 1.2), and that ICT security threats are a challenge in the use of ICT systems (Mean = 3.5, Std. dev = 1.2).</p>
            
                <p>However, there were factors that the respondents showed uncertainty about, including the fact that insufficient funds hinder the continuity of system operations (Mean = 3.1, Std. dev = 1.2), and that resistance to change due to technology is one of the challenges at KPLC (Mean = 3.0, Std. dev = 1.2), and that poor implementation and deployment of the system have created problems in business operations (Mean = 3.3, Std. dev = 1.3).</p>
