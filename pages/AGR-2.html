            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
            <p>As shown in the objectives, the researcher sought to investigate how demographic characteristics influence maize production of smallholder farmers in Jos South. The study showed that smallholder farmers in Jos South are aware that younger farmers adopt new technology easily and fast as compared to old people. On the level of education that adopts new technology easily and fast, the findings show that smallholder farmers in Jos South are aware that the farmers who attained the highest level of education (post-graduates) adopt new technology easily and fast as compared to farmers who managed to attain low-level education (primary level).</p>

            <p>Concerning the question asking whether male-headed households are more productive than female-headed households, the findings show that 87.7% strongly agree with the statement and only a few disagree. This could be possible because males have access to most of the resources as compared to women, for example, current information, financial resources, and extension services. On the issue of accessibility to credit facilities by gender, the findings show that the majority of respondents indicated that male-headed households access credit facilities more than female-headed households. This may be due to the fact that male-headed households seek to find information about different credit facilities offered in the market as compared to women. As a result, more males access credit facilities as compared to women.</p>

            <p>The researcher also sought to investigate how the cost of production affects maize production of smallholder farmers in Jos South. The study shows that the majority of smallholder farmers in Jos South use unpaid family labor, followed by animal draught power, then hired labor, and only a few percentages use mechanical power or machines as their source of power for land preparation. This may be due to the fact that the smallholder farmers have a low income base to enable them to hire machinery or skilled labor.</p>

            <p>Concerning awareness of climate change and its effects, the study shows that most of the smallholder farmers in Jos South are aware of climate change and its effects, and most of the farmers were affected by climate change. The response showed that smallholder farmers in Jos South are affected by extreme temperature changes, shift in seasons, and changing rainfall patterns which then lead to low maize yield.</p>
