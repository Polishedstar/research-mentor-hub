            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>A magnificent gift to mankind and highly indispensable, the newspaper performs a crucial role as a communicator and a link between government and people at large. Because of its importance and significance, it has been highly acclaimed, admired, and appreciated. It won't be unpalatable to say that what air is to living beings, the Press is to society.</p>
                <p>In this apparently free press scenario, the question remains: what issues get prominence in the press and why are others relegated to the back pages? Journalists, being aware of their role, can influence their audience and attract their attention to cooperate and participate in more equitable developmental plans.</p>
                <p>A news report fulfills the minimum criteria for the development of society if it consists of at least one of the following points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stresses the process and not the event</li>
                    <li>Maintains a critical perspective on development plans</li>
                    <li>Emphasizes people's needs</li>
                    <li>Presents a background for development issues</li>
                    <li>Predicts future needs</li>
                    <li>Considers the effect of plans on people</li>
                    <li>Compares the development process to similar processes in other places</li>
                    <li>Compares the plan with implemented results</li>
                    <li>Critically surveys stories of success</li>
                    <li>Points out people's needs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Politics, as we have been experiencing all along, is the staple of newspapers. But this is not all; other issues merit equal mention. Do other developmental issues get appropriate coverage, or do they get eclipsed under a huge cover of politics? These questions assume more importance when it comes to the coverage of developmental issues by newspapers and other print media. Enormous space is given by our media to business, and very little to social sectors like health and education. Most media correspondents attend to film stars, fashion parades, pop music, etc., and very few attend to the lives and problems of workers, farmers, students, sex workers, etc.</p>
                <p>A newspaper in a developing country ought to turn its attention quite frequently to various problems facing that country instead of being obsessed with politics and glamour. There are major problems facing Nigeria as a whole. A socially responsible press will turn its attention frequently to these problems and take a crusading attitude towards their solution.</p>
                <p>There are important roles that newspapers can play in the development of society that are not duplicated by other existing sources. To ensure the future of newspapers, though, it is necessary to make these roles clear, to pursue them, and to find ways to support them. This is the profound challenge that the newspaper industry will have to confront for years to come.</p>
