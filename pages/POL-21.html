            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Major findings of the study are summarized as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It was discovered that corruption and corrupt practices have not been properly tackled in NTA, Jos over the years despite the proliferation of anti-corruption policies and institutions put in place by successive governments in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>The findings revealed that mismanagement and misappropriation are the most common and pervasive types of corruption, and the phenomenon has negatively affected the performance of most public servants in the Plateau State Water Board, Jos.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that the Nigerian value system and systemic failure as a result of bad governance practices are the major causes of corruption in the local government council. Other causative factors include a lack of transparency and accountability and greed among personnel of the council.</li>
                    <li>The findings revealed that the menace of corruption has affected the performance of public servants at the local government level, which culminated in low/poor productivity, a reduction in government revenue generation, as well as the primitive accumulation of wealth.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that the problems of corruption and corrupt practices among personnel of local councils in Nigeria can be effectively tackled by stringent anti-corruption policies and laws, capital punishment sensitization campaigns, as well as strengthening of anti-graft institutions. It was also revealed that proper and regular auditing, remuneration, rewards, as well as personnel supervision and discipline can tame the menace of corruption in the local government council and society at large.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Reflective of the manifestations of corruption in the political, social, administrative, and economic life of the Nigerian state is the decaying infrastructure, inadequate medical services, falling standard of education, neglect of the basic/fundamental needs of the people, loss of resources (human and material). Added to the above is the routine roadblock by conventional and mobile police. It could also be seen in the way and manner elections are conducted vis-Ã -vis electoral malpractices either by politicians, political parties, and electoral officials. Administrative bottlenecks that make it expedient for corrupt acts to thrive, inflation of contract sums so that certain groups of individuals or people could be compensated for their assistance before the contract was awarded, and ethnic clandestine and similar biological and primordial relationships are favored.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that bad governance is the bane of national development. In order to break this cycle, accountability and transparency have to be guaranteed, and the people have to be involved in issues that affect their lives and immediate environment. Transparency and accountability in governance will help increase a sense of national community.</p>
