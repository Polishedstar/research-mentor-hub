            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study concluded that social media chatting has had a negative impact on students' academic writing in Nigerian higher institutions. It was found that female students tend to use social media chatting more frequently than their male counterparts.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the study revealed that there is no significant difference among undergraduate students in Nigeria in terms of their level of participation in chatting. However, there is a significant difference in the perception of male and female students regarding the effectiveness of social media chatting on students' English Language writing.</p>
