            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the research conducted, the findings can be summarized as follows:</p>
                <p>From the study, the following were observed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Through the training of the NDE youth, they were able to become self-employed as it had a positive impact on them by:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increasing their income and diversifying their income base</li>
                        <li>Strengthening their individual capacity to meet their needs and become self-reliant</li>
                        <li>Maintaining a sense of belonging, allowing them to make independent decisions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The study also revealed that the youth in our society have a significant influence, and without the youth, our country would face significant challenges, as they form a substantial portion of the labor force.</li>
                    <li>The federal government initiated the program to ensure that a significant number of youths are trained to fit into the challenging modern society.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Nigerian government has directed that entrepreneurial development courses are taken by all students, especially those studying marketing or administration and management in higher institutions. The goal is to provide the theoretical foundation for these students in the hope that graduates will be more job creators than job seekers.</p>
                <p>Over the years, Plateau State has taken a number of measures in the areas of entrepreneurship development and poverty alleviation. The aim of entrepreneurship development is to foster economic growth and development, leading to poverty alleviation among citizens.</p>
                <p>However, the measures have not yielded the desired results. Economic growth in Plateau State has remained relatively low, and the level of poverty among Nigerians continues to increase. The relationship between entrepreneurship development and poverty levels is negative, suggesting that higher entrepreneurship development leads to lower poverty levels. In Nigeria's case, low entrepreneurship development is linked to the high poverty rate.</p>
                <p>Effective entrepreneurship development programs should be included in comprehensive approaches to poverty eradication in Nigeria.</p>
