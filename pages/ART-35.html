            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Chapter one presents the statement of the problem and underlined the importance of radio. Since knowledge is achieved through communication, it looked into the relevance of radio to expose it for messages and the reportage of political parties' activities in Nigeria set the time for the study. The statement of the problem explored listeners' perception of Unity FM (Jos) programs on political parties' participation, taking Unity FM as a case study. It examined the extent to which Unity FM Jos is perceived as giving equal airtime to political parties, looking at the role of radio in sustaining democracy.</p>
                <p>Chapter two reviewed relevant literature, including empirical studies and the theoretical framework. This chapter described audience assessment as a task that is often performed by individuals to analyze the audience's reaction to information pertaining to political parties' activities. Nigeria, being a developing nation, needs a well-structured and effective media to reshape and restructure its ideologies, living patterns, and perception of events, acting as checks and balances on the activities of the ruling class. The development media theory recognized the fact that societies undergoing a transition to independence and better material conditions often lack the infrastructure, the money, the traditions, the professional skills, and even the audience needed to sustain media institutions. The media is centered toward the development of society and recognizing the fact that it will be faced with challenges.</p>
                <p>Chapter three presented the research design procedure for data collection, sampling techniques, and statistical procedures for data analysis. The study used a structured and standardized questionnaire that comprises sections A and B. Section A is made up of demographic data, and section B includes items to measure the variables. The responses were summarized into numerical values and represented via tables.</p>
                <p>Chapter four presented the analysis of data collected from the field, which focuses on listeners' perception of Unity FM (Jos) programs on political parties' participation, with a case study of Unity FM Jos station. Data collected during the course of this study were analyzed and presented to observe participants' responses to the questions, aiming to find credible solutions to the research problems.</p>
