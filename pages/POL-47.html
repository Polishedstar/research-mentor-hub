            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research draws the summary from the questions that were asked and answered in the questionnaires. The researcher gets to understand that small-scale businesses have a positive role and impact on the growth and development of a local government economy using businesses in Jos North Local Government Area in particular. In the course of this research, the researcher realizes some positive effects of small-scale businesses in the creation of a positive impact on the economy.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Small businesses act as a catalyst for rural development.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the businesses have enough facilities to accommodate their customers while some do not.</li>
                    <li>Small businesses perform effectively without government assistance.</li>
                    <li>Small-scale industries increase the standard of living in the rural community.</li>
                    <li>Small-scale industries are comfortable with government's regulations and legislations regarding small businesses.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the past chapters, the researcher has tried to examine the role of small-scale industries in rural development. The researcher also looked at how they have been contributing and also the problems associated with small businesses in Jos North Local Government Area.</p>
                <p>With small-scale industries, at least an increased number of graduates from various institutions who roam the streets seeking placement in few declared vacancies can avail themselves of the opportunity available to make a living.</p>
                <p>Many small businesses are destined to become big businesses, but because of one problem or another, they have not achieved that goal. When small business improves in an economy, there is a tendency that in the future they can become a large business, and this can be achievable if moral and financial support from government agencies is given.</p>
