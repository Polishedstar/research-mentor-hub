            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This section is provided for discussion and recommendations, considering the preceding chapters. The research aim of writing on the topic "Personal Selling and its Effects on Sales Volume of a Product" is to measure the effectiveness and evaluate the extent to which personal selling can be adopted during the first stage of the product life cycle, ensuring that it will not become ineffective before reaching the growth and maturity stage. In a case where this happens, there would be a positive correlation between effective expenditure and sales volume. Effective personal selling must be able to capture individuals' attention, create interest and desire, and it must follow the Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action (AIDA) theory, particularly for businesses that use personal selling techniques, with reference to NASCO Group Company.</p>
                <p>Effective personal selling has been identified as very important for the sales volume of a new product, as well as for creating awareness and promoting other purchasing tools. Additionally, from this research work, the researcher was able to identify the product available in the town as feeds.</p>
            
                <p>Therefore, the aim of this research work has been achieved, and also the objective, which is to identify the common means of communication between the organization and its consumers, as well as knowing the sales volume of a product in the market.</p>
