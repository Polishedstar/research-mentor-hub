            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study examined the contextualization of modernist style and the implications of design inadequacies in Obafemi Awolowo University buildings in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The research was motivated by the need to ensure the continuous availability and reliability of university buildings, which are essential for providing uninterrupted academic and research activities that the institution was established for. To achieve this, proactive actions taken during the design stage play a crucial role.</p>
                <p>The study aimed to explore various aspects of the design, including design configurations, climatic response, architectural expression and perception, design problems, and the physical impact on the selected Obafemi Awolowo University buildings. The goal was to provide insights that would enhance the quality of future building design and performance, with a particular focus on the form, elements, and workability of the lecture theatres.</p>
                <p>The findings of the study revealed the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The buildings under review were not consciously designed to fit the climatic context of Ile Ife and other functional requirements. Unlike the modernist style, which is not only designed for aesthetics, inbuilt design inadequacies were identified.</li>
                    <li>Inadequate roof fall, insufficient moisture treatments, and the inaccessibility of defective components, as well as inconsideration or lack of attention to design from the inception, were identified as the major design inadequacies and errors in the construction method.</li>
                    <li>Opened eaves, poor construction techniques, and the absence of wind breakers were some of the identified factors responsible for destructive wind actions on most lecture theater roofs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The study serves as a valuable resource for addressing design inadequacies and improving the future design of university buildings in the context of Ile-Ife, Nigeria.</p>
