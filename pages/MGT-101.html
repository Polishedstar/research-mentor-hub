            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research empirically tested the effect of employee job satisfaction on Quality Service delivery and the role of employee commitment. The research findings are summarized as follows:</p>
            
                <h3>Effect of Employee Job Satisfaction on Quality Service Delivery</h3>
                <p>Following the data analysis conducted, employee satisfaction was not found to have any effect on service quality delivery. Notwithstanding the result in this research context, there are first-hand research conclusions, as seen in the literature review, making a claim that employee satisfaction has an effect on service quality. Thus, from the perspective of the respondents in the study, their satisfaction levels with their job do not lead them to provide quality service to their clients.</p>
            
                <h3>Effect of Employee Job Satisfaction on Employee Commitment</h3>
                <p>Employee satisfaction was found to have a positive effect on commitment levels. Thus, the more an employee is satisfied with the job, the more commitment will be exhibited toward work and the organization, which, in the end, will culminate in the quality of service.</p>
            
                <h3>Effect of Employee Commitment on Quality Service Delivery</h3>
                <p>The study finds out that the effect of employee commitment on service quality was proved to be positive. This means employees who are extra committed to their work are more likely to deliver quality service in the performance of their duties.</p>
            
                <h3>The Mediating Role of Employee Commitment on Employee Job Satisfaction and Quality Service Delivery</h3>
                <p>It was discovered from the analysis of the study that employee commitment mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and quality service delivery among some selected hospitals in Jos metropolis. This means that even though if an employee is satisfied with his/her job to an extent, it takes commitment to deliver quality service. This is because so many satisfied workers still take their job for granted despite the fact that the pay and other incentives are sufficient enough to motivate them to deliver quality. Therefore, in any organization where quality is delivered by the employee, it goes beyond satisfaction. Commitment on the part of the employee is the main driving force towards quality service delivery.</p>
