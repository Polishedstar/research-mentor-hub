            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Through the presentation and analysis of data collected, the following were my findings:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>The study revealed that corporate planning helps in defining clearly organization problems and methods of achieving them in JED Plc.</li>
                    <li>The study also revealed that corporate planning helps in identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the organization.</li>
                    <li>The study revealed that corporate planning helps in performance evaluation and employee mental development.</li>
                    <li>Corporate planning helped in keeping staff in shape and improving their performance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A thorough look at the findings of the study revealed that the evaluation of corporate planning as a strategy for enhancing management efficiency is a vital and integral tool of insurance operations, especially in modern insurance. This makes it challenging and demanding for them to meet up with their customers.</p>
            
                <p>Evaluation of corporate planning helps general management to identify, define, and formulate a company's vision and mission. It also aids insurance firms in selecting performance targets and objectives that the firm wishes to achieve.</p>
            
                <p>Also, it was postulated that an evaluation plan helps the management of the firm in the identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the organization.</p>
