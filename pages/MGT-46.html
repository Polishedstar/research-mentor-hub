            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total quality management (TQM) is in practice in Zenith Bank Plc, and almost all the staff are aware of it. This implies that members of staff have adopted TQM, and every staff is involved in the practice.</li>
                    <li>The major elements of TQM practice in the bank include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continuous quality improvement</li>
                        <li>Compulsory innovations</li>
                        <li>Reduced cost of service delivery</li>
                        <li>Cultural change at all levels of the organization</li>
                        <li>Teamwork spirit</li>
                        <li>Customer satisfaction/involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The practice of TQM affects or improves customer services and care. This is as a result of continuous improvement in quality.</li>
                    <li>The major limitations of the practice of TQM in the bank are lack of constant training in TQM, inconsistent approaches, and irregular TQM practice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is a high level of awareness of TQM among staff of Zenith Bank Plc. TQM practice has been adopted to a large extent by the staff, and they are largely involved in the practice as well. The practice of TQM significantly improves customer service delivery and care. This implies that TQM is a customer-oriented practice that calls for steady improvement in service quality to meet the expectations of the customers. Innovations are inevitable in this process.</p>
