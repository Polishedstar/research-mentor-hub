            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The major aim of this study is centered on what must be done to improve peace building and sustainable National development in Jos-North local government area and of what importance is peace building in our societies. Peace is the engine or the root that influences the effectiveness and efficiency of every society so that sustainable development could be obtained.</p>
                <p>The success of every governance or failures depends on how peace is handled. With this regard, individuals, groups, and religious bodies in Jos-North local government area are therefore urged to be peacekeepers rather than creating hatred among themselves.</p>
                <p>The literature review contributed a lot to what must be done to improve peace and sustainable National development and its relevance to the study. The contributions and theories by different scholars regarding this project also contributed immensely to the success of the research. Such theories included the peace theory by Rudyard Kipling (2011) and the permanent theory of peace, which talked about "Replacing the wrong (what IF?) with the right (IF)," and a "Field theory of consciousness," respectively. The selection of sample size and the issuance of questionnaires used as a survey tool in the primary data collection. Information pertaining to the secondary collection was gathered from different scholars and the internet.</p>
                <p>Going by the presentation and analysis of the data, the use of questionnaires to reach out to the people of Jos-North local government area, especially the youth and members of uniform voluntary organizations of the two major religions (Christianity and Islam), revealed their concerns and lapses.</p>
                <p>The respondents strongly indicated that the government and community leaders need to establish concrete measures to sustain peace and development, with a rating of 84.1% of the respondents.</p>
