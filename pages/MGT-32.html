                <h3>PROSPECT</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It creates employment opportunities for rural people.</li>
                    <li>It generates revenue for the local government through tax and levy.</li>
                    <li>It helps in providing food for the nation.</li>
                    <li>It reduces rural-urban migration.</li>
                    <li>Marketing of agricultural produce enhances effective and efficient distribution of the commodity.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of adequate agricultural research.</li>
                    <li>Poor positioning or misunderstanding of customers' needs.</li>
                    <li>Lack of financial resources.</li>
                    <li>Poor weather or climate conditions.</li>
                    <li>Lack of modern technology.</li>
                    <li>Poor marketing strategies.</li>
                    <li>Diseases, pests, and evasion.</li>
                </ul>            
                <p>From the results of data collected and analyzed, the following conclusions can be drawn: Competitors should be considered while determining the business environment. It is possible for an organization to be affected if the prospects and challenges of the business factors are not well considered. Proper recognition of business prospects plays a significant role in the survival of an organization.</p>
                <p>From the above-stated points and data analysis earlier on, it has been revealed that the impact of prospects is highly significant in the life of the selected all farmers' association in Plateau State.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole discussion, we will conclude that prospect is the most effective instrument that can be used by the organization to know the opinion of the general public, government, shareholders, competitors, and others. Conclusively, business environment conditions are related to the survival or failure of an organization.</p>
