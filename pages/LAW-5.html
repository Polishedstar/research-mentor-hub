            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work aimed at the examination of the applicability of the duty of care and laws regulating negligence in Nigeria. Despite the limited Nigerian literature and case law on this topic, the writer has been able to substantially achieve this aim. The research made certain findings which no doubt will go a long way in enlightening litigants on the viability of the tort of medical negligence.</p>
                <p>This work has found that medical negligence is the commission or omission of an act by a medical professional or health care provider, which deviates from the accepted standards of practice of the medical community. This definition flows from the general meaning of negligence, which means the breach of a duty caused by the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by the same considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.</p>
                <p>Medical negligence as a tort was also found to arise from the fiduciary relationship existing between the medical practitioner and a patient. This fiduciary relationship stems from the duty of care and confidence that the medical profession, like most other professions, is built on. A breach of the duty arising from this relationship by the Doctor who is the fiduciary exposes the Doctor to liability either by criminal action, civil action, or administrative action by the Medical and Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal.</p>
                <p>The acts or omissions that can give rise to any of these actions include, inter alia, the retention of objects in operation sites, failure to attend and/or give prompt attention, incorrect diagnosis, failure of communication; incompetent assessment of a patient; failure to take a full medical history; errors in treating patients; improper administration of injection; and failure to get the consent of the patient. The list of the acts that may amount to medical negligence as discussed in this work is not exhaustive; all that the law requires is that whatever act is complained against, the act must meet the criteria of the law on the necessary ingredients of the tort of negligence.</p>
                <p>In the body of this essay, it was established that a plaintiff in an action for medical negligence must prove three necessary ingredients of the tort - to wit; that the defendant owed him a duty of care, that the defendant breached this duty of care, and that the breach occasioned the injury suffered by the plaintiff. These ingredients must be established concurrently, and failure to prove any of the ingredients leads to the failure of the case of the plaintiff. On the duty of care, it was found that, by the nature of the relationship between the Doctor and the patient, and also arising from the "neighbour" principle, the Doctor owes the patient a duty of care which duty he must not breach.</p>
                <p>The standard of care required of the Doctor is generally that degree of care which a reasonable person should exercise in the same or similar circumstances. A Doctor will be said to have acted within the scope of this duty if he acts towards the patient, as any reasonable Doctor in his position and within the same circumstance will act.</p>
                <p>The next ingredient of medical negligence as seen in this research work is that it must be shown that the Doctor breached his duty of care. This breach occurs where the Doctor or the hospital fails in its duty of care owed to the patient, as required by law. It was found to be trite law that for a Doctor to be held liable for breach of duty of care, he must be found to have acted below the standard of care expected of him in the particular circumstance, and the test for determining whether or not there is a breach of duty is an objective test of what the reasonable Doctor in those circumstances will do. It was also established with authorities that the fact that there is another method of carrying out the treatment or operation is not conclusive that the Doctor in that particular case has breached his duty of care. A medical practitioner would not be found guilty of negligence unless he has done something of which his colleagues would say 'He really made a mistake. He ought not to have done it.'</p>
                <p>The final ingredient which must be proved is that the breach of duty of the medical practitioner was the cause of the injury of the patient. Here, the proximity or causal link between the breach by the medical practitioner and the injury suffered by the patient must be established. The basic test for causation is the 'but-for test.' It was, however, established that there are instances where the basic test is inapplicable, thus, its modification or total departure from the test. Consideration is then given to each case based on its circumstance, which then gives birth to tests such as 'loss of opportunity test,' 'material contribution test,' and 'independent cause test.'</p>
                <p>The work went on to examine the considerations relating to the scope of liability of a medical practitioner for breach of the duty of care, which is the crux of the essay. It was established that the injury suffered by the patient must be a reasonable consequence of the breach of duty by the medical practitioner. The injury must be reasonably foreseeable and not too remote a consequence of the breach. The developing state of medicine and medical practice can limit the scope of liability of a medical practitioner for breach of the duty of care. Where a plaintiff fails to prove that the breach is the cause of the injury, then a case of medical negligence cannot or will not see the light of day on the one hand, on the other hand, where a plaintiff can establish a causal link between the breach and the injury, there are defenses that can avail the medical practitioner of liability or reduce his liability. These defenses include; contributory negligence, volenti non fit injuria, technical imperfection, necessity and emergency, and accepted standard of conduct.</p>
                <p>From the above findings that this work has made, it is obvious that the law on medical negligence is not as uncertain as it is thought to be. The law is certain in its conferment on the injured patient</p>
