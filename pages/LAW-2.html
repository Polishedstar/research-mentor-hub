            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In tackling the research problems, which was an assessment of Nigeria's Afro-centric leadership, the study was organized in six chapters.</p>
            
                <p>The first, "Introduction," contained background to the research, the statement of the research, the relevance of the study, the objectives of the study, the theoretical frameworks, the propositions that guided our research, the methodology, and the limitations to the research.</p>
            
                <p>Basically, the overriding objective in carrying out the research was to find out the thrust in Nigeria's external relations in Africa between 1999 and 2007. The central proposition was that the development of Nigeria's human, material, and economic resources, etc. is likely to impact positively on Nigeria's Afro-centric leadership. We opted for the political economy model as the framework of analysis. It was picked out of a long array of theoretical models in foreign policy because it was suited to our kind of research. We felt that using it would assist us in mirroring Nigerian Afro-centric relations between 1999 and 2007, the research being an impact type.</p>
            
                <p>We also proved propositions two, three, and four. In our view and the revelation in our analysis, the peripheral status of Nigeria turned Nigeria literally into a beggar nation. We can, therefore, say that all the four propositions have been proved as shown from the policies of the various regimes, especially those of Obasanjo's, 1999 â€“ 2007.</p>
