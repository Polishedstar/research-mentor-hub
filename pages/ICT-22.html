            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study investigated "Impact of Information and Communication Technology on Teaching and Learning of Business Education in Colleges of Education in Plateau State."</p>
                <p>The major findings from the data analysis and test of the hypotheses are summarized below. The study revealed that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The use of Computer Assisted Instruction method has a significant impact on improving the academic performance of students than the conventional method of teaching in Colleges of Education in Plateau State. The mean difference between the experimental and control groups when compared were 27.21 and -27.21 respectively;</li>
                    <li>The use of Computer Assisted Instruction has a significant impact on increasing the speed of solving questions among students than the use of the conventional method of teaching the subject. The experimental group spent 41.35 minutes while the control group spent 56.50 minutes in answering the EAT questions;</li>
                    <li>Computer Assisted Instruction has a significant impact on enhancing the rate of independent learning skills acquisition among students than the conventional method of teaching the subject. The experimental group had a mean score performance of 4.23 higher than the control group with a mean score of 1.47;</li>
                    <li>The use of Computer Assisted Instruction in teaching did not have a significant impact on gender performances among male and female students. This means that the use of CAI enhanced the performances of both male and female students in Business Education almost equally with mean scores of 62.41 and 61.14 respectively;</li>
                    <li>The impact of Computer Assisted Instruction in teaching is not significantly affected by the location of students' schools. This means the use of CAI is not influenced by the location of schools because students in the experimental group in the urban and rural areas performed almost equally with mean scores of 61.80 and 61.78 respectively;</li>
                    <li>Computer Assisted Instruction for teaching has no significant impact on male and female students' rate of acquiring independent learning skills such as keyboarding and browsing of information. This means male and female students did not differ in their rate of acquiring independent learning skills using Computer Assisted Instruction with mean scores of 4.25 and 4.20 respectively.</li>
