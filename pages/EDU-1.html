    </header>
    
    <main>
        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the analysis and interpretation of the results of findings, research questions, and research hypotheses, it can be concluded that stakeholders had similar views regarding the impact of funding on general and daily management practices in secondary schools. This similarity also extends to the impact of funding on educational policy planning and the implementation of decisions in secondary schools. Likewise, stakeholders had similar views concerning the impact of funding on instructional and learning materials, as well as the impact of funding on infrastructural facilities. Furthermore, stakeholders shared similar opinions on the impact of funding on students' academic and welfare services, and the impact of other sources of funding outside government funding on the management of secondary schools in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, stakeholders had significantly different views regarding the impact of funding on teachers' motivation and retention. This difference in perspective also applies to the impact of funding on effective communication management. Similarly, they had differing opinions on the impact of funding on teacher's quality and staff development in secondary schools in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>The study then comes out with the following final conclusions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Funds allocated for funding secondary education are inadequate.</li>
                    <li>Funds allocated and internally generated revenue are not put to proper use or are mismanaged.</li>
                    <li>Two different budgets used for funding secondary schools lead to duplication of the same sub-heads as two different allocations are made for the same sub-head, leading to misappropriation and mismanagement.</li>
                    <li>Principals tap into other sources of funding and use cost-saving devices in managing funds allocated to them.</li>
                    <li>Funds allocated for policy, planning, and implementation are insufficient.</li>
                    <li>Funds allocated for teachers' motivation are inadequate.</li>
                    <li>Funds available for staff development are insufficient.</li>
                    <li>Funds allocated for effective communication management are not enough.</li>
                    <li>Facilities for effective teaching and learning are inadequate and poorly managed.</li>
                    <li>Existing infrastructural facilities are not adequate and are not very functional.</li>
                    <li>Allocation for student academic and welfare services is not adequate.</li>
                    <li>Parents, individuals, public corporations, international organizations participate in funding secondary education.</li>
                </ol>
