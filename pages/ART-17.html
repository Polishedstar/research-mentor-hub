    </header>
    
    <main>
        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study conducted an assessment of the dependency or usage of the services of the News Agency of Nigeria by the Nigerian newspapers. Using simple random sampling methods, five Nigerian newspapers were selected from 55 print media organizations that subscribe to the media contents offered by NAN. Respondents were drawn from these five newspapers for a face-to-face extensive interview, using the research questions designed for the study.</p>
            
                <p>From the face-to-face interviews conducted, some facts came to light regarding the weaknesses of NAN as a media organization. Virtually all the respondents complained about the stereotype focus of NAN on reporting governments and other segments of society like the corporate world, foreign news, as well as probing deeply into corruption and other issues in society.</p>
            
                <p>One fact that emerged is that because of the vast reach of NAN, having offices in many parts of the country, its service remains relevant and indispensable in the media industry. Almost all the respondents interviewed attested to the fact that NAN has an edge in the coverage of grassroots. They noted that no newspaper could afford to open offices in all the 36 states of the federation, let alone cover all the local governments in the country. So, they find it more economical to subscribe to NAN's media contents than to waste resources on opening offices everywhere.</p>
            
                <p>Besides, it was also discovered from the interview that the agency operates more like a typical civil service set-up rather than operating in a dynamic way typical of a true media outfit. For instance, one of the respondents, the Daily Editor of National Mirror, had this to say:</p>
            
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“…I think the most important thing is that they (NAN) should get out of this government yoke of civil service mentality. This idea of operating only between 7:30 am to 3:30 pm is not ideal; so what happens after that (3:30 pm)? Journalism has gone beyond that except you want to serve as information officers for government houses or for ministries and parastatals. But if you must really operate with the name “news agency”, they (NAN) should move and deploy resources to areas where the newspapers are not operating. Most newspapers have correspondents in many states in the country, and they are competing with NAN. So why can‟t NAN deploy resources where the papers are operating, go outside the country. I know NAN used to do that before; you have correspondents in Europe, US, and so on. So, if finance is the problem of NAN and it wants to run on a commercial basis to break even, it has to also break out of government circle so that it can be self-sustaining. Look at AP. Associated Press is being run as a pure commercial news agency; it is not owned by the American government, it is pure commercial…”</p>
                </blockquote>
            
                <p>For the quantitative aspect of data gathering for the study, three newspapers from the population of 55 subscribers - The Nation, The Punch, and Vanguard - were also selected randomly for content analysis. The study was limited to the last year, 2013, while simple logic was used to choose the last quarters of that year, specifically October, November, and December for the study. The publications of these three media organizations were reviewed for 92 out of 365 days of the year.</p>
            
                <p>From this review, it was discovered that media organizations still found it more convenient to use NAN copies, especially from remote parts of the country where many newspapers could not maintain offices. Many of the NAN stories published by the newspapers reviewed were from communities, courts, and governments - local, state, and federal. It was also found out that although many of the NAN copies were used inside pages, thus without much prominence, newspapers, however, found NAN photos more useful and used them on both front and back pages as they deemed fit. For instance, the Deputy Editor of The Nation attested to the fact that NAN photos are usually sharper and clearer than those of the company's photographers.</p>
            
                <p>One major constraint encountered during the content analysis is that not all newspapers that subscribe to NAN's service credit the agency when its copies are used. This made it difficult for this research to identify NAN stories. Some newspapers have the habit of not crediting NAN when its story is used. They do this with the argument that since they pay for the service, they are not obliged to credit NAN. Those who engage in this practice only credit NAN when they use a story which they feel could lead to litigation. This practice runs contrary to the copyright policy.</p>
