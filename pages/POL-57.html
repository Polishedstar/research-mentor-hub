            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The aim of this research, as earlier stated in the first chapter, is to carefully examine in detail the leadership development and its impact on employee performance in an organization. This is to provide a clear understanding of the relationship that exists, galvanizing training and organizational output into a cornerstone of result-oriented effort. The ever-increasing need for leadership development had led the Nigerian government to formulate a new approach to the problem of leadership development, which led to the establishment of the Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre.</p>
                <p>To enhance efficient and effective performance in an organization to meet the demands of our time and future generations, organizational content and methods must constantly be improved. A search for leadership training strategies and concepts has to be undertaken.</p>
                <p>Man is a rational animal, and when he behaves in a certain way, he does so for a reason. If we want people to behave with a positive attitude to help the organization achieve its goals, then the leadership style should be flexible to accommodate opinions from all, creating a good working relationship and a sense of belongingness.</p>
                <p>Although finance plays a decisive role in manpower development, management should view it from a comparative advantage perspective derived from such training and endeavor to sponsor their workers for leadership training.</p>
