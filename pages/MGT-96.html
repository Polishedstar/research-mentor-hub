            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Small and medium-scale businesses vary from country to country, emerging with the economy of such countries. These types of businesses fall within the capital range of 100,000 to 5 million investment, including the working capital. This category of business in Nigeria often faces problems that lead to their rapid collapse, and some of those problems include a shortage of funds, non-qualified and misuse of funds by the operators.</p>
                <p>Despite government intervention to sustain the life of these businesses by establishing financial agencies to assist with loans, these businesses still have problems. This should be looked into in order to sustain the life of the business. Other scholars and writers' works were examined in the light of variables speculated in the research questions, in addition to the cordial relationship between the researcher and the respondents. The population was stated, and samples for the study were selected.</p>
                <p>The study comprised financial staff totaling 25 and 15, respectively, were randomly selected to arrive at 2 and 10, respectively. Questionnaires and oral interviews were used to collect data, while tables of percentages were used for the analysis. The analysis in Chapter Four shows that methods of financing small and medium-scale businesses are independently used, which could create problems for the business.</p>
                <p>Majority of the operations of these businesses were not opportune to obtain loans and solely depended on their personal savings. Those who obtained loans could not put them into the business well by converting them into different uses. Lack of qualified and skilled personnel and non-adequate and up-to-date record-keeping contributed to many of the problems of the business.</p>
                <p>All organizations have organizational charts, and their charts are reviewed on a yearly basis. Small and medium-scale businesses persuade the government to provide infrastructure to rural areas and food production. They could be limited liability companies by law and borrow money from the government and also interest with them as shareholders.</p>
                <p>These businesses raise their funds through loans from financial institutions, the government, and individuals. Non-provision of qualified and skilled staff leads to the short lifespan of the business, while proper record-keeping contributes immensely to the success of this business. The business could still maintain its cordial relationship with financial institutions by paying their debts, even when defaults occur.</p>
                <p>Engaging experienced and skilled personnel, keeping proper and up-to-date records, and promptly repaying loans can sustain the business and prevent collapse.</p>
                <p>Finally, the financial and investment aspect of the business is also handled by the directors.</p>
