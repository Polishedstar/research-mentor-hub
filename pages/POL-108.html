            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research has been able to carry out an empirical analysis of the merits of local government investment in Jos North Local Government. It also looked at the strategies for improving revenue generation for development in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau state.</p>
                <p>In the light of the findings of this study, the researcher concludes that the level of revenue accruable to the local government is inadequate to make a meaningful positive impact on the development of the rural areas of the local government. The implication is that the internally generated revenue base of the local government should be diversified so that the council will be able to provide relevant social services and infrastructural development in the local government. Revenue generated in the area has not been able to impact meaningfully on the development of the area under analysis. The inability to generate sufficient revenue in the area is a clear bane on rural development in the local government area.</p>
