            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study concludes that the pronunciation made by media practitioners that Hausa broadcasters of English use RP English is not accurate because of the already demonstrated reasons.</p>
            
                <p>The researcher has carried out investigations on consonant articulation of the subjects and it is concluded that there is the use of frication in their articulations where /p/ is realized as [ɸ]. This process has produced semantic alteration and accent marker. For instance, the word pin /pɪn/ is realized as fin [ɸ ɪ n], this process shows alteration of meaning whereas the word police /p ə l i: s/ is realized [ɸ o l ɪ s] that indicates accent marker which shows the identity of the speaker (cf. p. 74).</p>
                
                <p>Therefore, these changes violate the rule of RP English and mark the speech of Hausa broadcasters of English different from RP. Similarly, the interdental /θ/ and /ð/ are also substituted with /t/, /s/, /d/, and /z/. /θ/ is realized as [t] or [s]. This process has produced semantic alteration and accent marker. Examples, thank /θæŋk/ becomes tank [t a n k], think /θ ɪ ŋ k/ is realized as sink [s ɪ n k], these are semantic alteration. On the other hand, when Thursday /θ ɜ: z d e ɪ/ is realized as tosde [t o s d e] it shows accent marker (cf. p. 93). /ð/ is substituted with [d] or [z]. For instance, the /ð ə/ is realized as [de], it indicates accent marker whereas when those /ð ə ʊ z/ is altered to [d o s], it shows semantic alteration.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, /ʒ/ becomes [dʒ] which shows semantic alteration and accent marker. Similarly, when leisure /l e ʒ ə/ is realized as ledger [l e dʒ o], it indicates semantic alteration while pleasure /p l e ʒ ə/ is realized as filejo [[ɸ ɪ l e dʒ o] it shows accent marker (cf. p. 126). In view of the above we conclude that the majority of the respondents do not use RP. They handle consonants phonemes in an unusual way like allophones while they are phonemes.</p>
                
                <p>Another aspect that has taken the center stage in the research is the articulation of vowels. The vowels have been categorized and examined based on certain articulatory features. These are the feature length and diphthongs. The study concludes that the feature length is lacking in the speech of the Hausa broadcasters. Even though the feature length does exist in Hausa language, it is not used by the subjects. Investigations reveal that the feature length in Hausa is associated with the tone patterns; however, English is not a tonal language but rather a stress language. This might have been the reason why RP long vowels are not realized by the subjects. For instances, leave / l i: v/ is realized as l ɪ v [l ɪ v] which shows semantic alteration. People /p i: p ə l/ is pronounced as [ɸ ɪ ɸ ʊ l] which indicates accent marker.</p>
                
                <p>At the level of short vowels articulations, the study concludes that there is a vowel transfer from the Hausa vowel trapezium to Hausa English. The vowels affected are mid-back rounded vowel [o] and low central short unrounded [a]. These vowels do not exist in RP and are used in place of three RP central vowels schwa /ə/, caret /ʌ/, nurse /ɜ:/, and low front short vowel /æ/. The vowels are unregistered in the vowel trapezium of Hausa, hence the realization of [o] and [a] as replacements. For examples, Editor /e d ɪ t ə/ becomes Edito [e d ɪ t o] which indicates accent marker.</p>
                
                <p>Similarly, the study also realizes the case of monophthongization of diphthongs at the level of diphthongs articulation where only one part of the vowel is produced as in /eɪ/ which is reduced to [e]. This process also produced accent marker and semantic alteration. The word late /l e ɪ t/ becomes let [l e t] though showing semantic alteration, data /d e ɪ t ə/ becomes data [d a t a] indicating accent marker. Moreover, there is an introduction of a new diphthong [ɪa] in the speech of the subjects. The diphthong is used by the subjects in place of centering diphthong /eə/ alongside /ja/ glide. This phoneme [ɪa] does not exist in either English or Hausa phonemic inventory, but it is closer to RP English centering diphthong /ɪə/. In this case, rare /r eə/ becomes [r ɪ a], a semantic alteration while scare /s k e ə/ becomes sikiya [s ɪ k ɪ a], an accent marker. This is another breakthrough in the phonology of Hausa language. At present, Hausa language has only four diphthongs: /aɪ/, /au/, /uɪ/, and /ɪu/. The phonological processes used by the majority of the respondents make their speech different from RP.</p>
