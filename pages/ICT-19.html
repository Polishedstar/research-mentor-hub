            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was undertaken to identify the digital technology competencies required by OTM graduates for effective performance in an organization. To facilitate the conduct of the study, four purposes of the study were postulated from which four research questions were raised. The study adopted the descriptive survey research design, and the population for the study consisted of 83 students of office technology and management at Plateau State Polytechnic, Barkin Ladi. The entire study population was adopted for the study since the population was not too large. The questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection, and the instrument was subjected to face and content validation by the researcher's supervisor. Data collected for the study were analyzed using the mean rating on a four-point Likert scale.</p>
                <p>The study revealed the following findings among others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The digital technology competencies required by OTM graduates for effective performance in an organization include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to use different internet connection options</li>
                        <li>Ability to use electronic mail (e-mail) and social networking services</li>
                        <li>Ability to use interactive web applications and whiteboard</li>
                        <li>Ability to use database applications, personal digital assistants, and various office applications</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Digital technology competencies encourage innovation and creativity, bring about effective coordination of tasks, make work faster, serve as an enabler for collaboration through real-time communication, and increase worker efficiency by streamlining office work. Other benefits include eliminating geographical barriers, optimizing operations, conducting information exchanges, and saving time and effort required to do work.</li>
                    <li>The acquisition of digital technology competencies is challenged by factors such as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inadequate computer laboratory</li>
                        <li>Lack of skills or capacity</li>
                        <li>Unwillingness to adopt new technologies</li>
                        <li>Overemphasis on theory</li>
                        <li>Inadequate public power supply</li>
                        <li>Poor and non-sustainable funding</li>
                        <li>Overadmission of students</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The strategies for improved acquisition of digital technology competencies include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provision of adequate computer laboratory</li>
                        <li>Capacity-building programs for teachers</li>
                        <li>Willingness to adopt new technologies</li>
                        <li>Emphasis on practicals</li>
                        <li>Providing alternative sources of electricity supply</li>
                        <li>Active private sector involvement in funding education</li>
                        <li>Ensuring strict adherence to approved carrying capacity during admission</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
