                <p>From the above, it is clear that young people are the greatest asset of any nation. They are the future of any nation and serve as the bridge that links the present to future generations. They are active, dynamic, and adventurous and can serve as agents of social action and social change.</p>
                <p>However, there is no doubt that the elders have failed to put in place effective development programs for the youth. It remains to be seen whether the youth will fail themselves and refuse to develop themselves and become agents of change. Leadership for change and entrepreneurship are imperative for young people to perform their historic role of being agents of social action and change in society. It was Frantz Fanon who said, "every generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfill it, or betray it." The past is gone. The future is a clean slate. Nigeria is at a juncture. The choice is yours - fulfill your mission or betray it.</p>
