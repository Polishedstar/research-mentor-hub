            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the data analyzed on Nasco, the following are the findings for this study on the effect of pricing policy on the sales turnover of Nasco foods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not all the staff of Nasco participate in its pricing decisions.</li>
                    <li>The factor that influences the price of Nasco products is the demand level of their products by customers.</li>
                    <li>The circumstances under which prices can be reviewed to achieve better sales turnover.</li>
                    <li>Nasco segments its markets based on behavioral aspects of consumers and geographical basis.</li>
                    <li>The prices of Nasco products are not the same in its different market segments.</li>
                    <li>The factors Nasco considers in setting its different prices for different market segments include peculiarity of the market, purchase occasion, and distribution distance.</li>
                    <li>A varied price for different market segments is the best for better sales turnover.</li>
                    <li>In determining the price of a product, the demand for such a product influences its price.</li>
                    <li>Nasco mostly uses market price approaches in pricing its products.</li>
                    <li>Nasco has never set a price just to recover its cost of production without considering buyers' reactions.</li>
                    <li>The circumstances in which Nasco should best review its product prices to achieve better sales are when there is an increase in the cost of production and poor demand levels.</li>
                    <li>The implications of poor pricing policy in Nasco's sales performance are a decrease in sales volume, low demand level, and a decline in profits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on the collected data and the analysis of data collected, the following conclusions were made regarding findings that pricing is an important factor in management decision-making and good pricing policy determines the long-term success of an organization. Good pricing policy has a great impact on the sales turnover of Nasco products because it leads to high customer patronization and an increase in sales volume. If a company does not establish a good pricing policy, it becomes poor pricing policy, and its implications are drastic enough to the extent that it can lead to the closure of the company. The reasons include a decrease in sales volume, a decrease in product demand, and a decline in profits.</p>
