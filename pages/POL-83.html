            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research was summarized based on the findings presented and analyzed in chapter four. The research findings are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Unemployment and drug abuse were identified as the causes of crime and youth restiveness.</li>
                    <li>Resolving unemployment creates industries and improves the welfare of youth.</li>
                    <li>The government has improved the attitudes of youth towards the community.</li>
                    <li>There are various approaches to resolving unemployment and drug addiction in the youth of Hwolshe community, depending on the situation.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Youth unemployment in Nigeria is endemic, and its consequences on both the youth and the entire country are undeniable. The adverse effects include increased poverty, hunger, social vices, and insecurity. About 70% of the Nigerian population is composed of youth, with roughly 71% of them unemployed, mostly graduates. This unemployment crisis negatively impacts the workforce and military of the country.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunate that qualified, willing, and able youth and graduates cannot find jobs and, as a result, cannot fulfill family or social responsibilities. They become frustrated and vulnerable, potentially lured into criminal activities. Engaging the youth productively would lead to positive youth development and benefit both individuals and society at large.</p>
