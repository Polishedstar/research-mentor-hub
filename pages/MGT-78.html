            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the results obtained from the administered questionnaire and factual reference in chapter four, the following undermentioned has been discovered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good working condition describes how content an individual is with his or her job. It is a relatively recent term since in previous centuries, the job available to a particular person was often predetermined by the occupation of that person's parent.</li>
                    <li>There are a variety of factors that influence a person’s level of working condition. Some of these factors include the level of pay and benefits, the perceived fairness of the promotion system within the organization, the quality of job satisfaction leadership and social relationship, the job itself (the variety of tasks involved, the interest and challenges the job generates, and the clarity of the work description or requirement).</li>
                    <li>The happier people are within their work, the more satisfied they are. Good working condition is not the same as motivation. A good working condition is a very important attribute which is frequently measured by organizations and increases employees' productivity. The most common way of measurement is the use of rating scales where employees report their reactions to their work. Questions relating to pay, work responsibility, variety of tasks, promotional opportunities, the workplace itself, and the relationship between workers and the organization were asked.</li>
                    <li>The main sub-work environment that helps the Bank to create a conducive physical working condition was when offices and workplaces that are well designed.</li>
                    <li>To create a conducive social workplace, co-workers of the employees must display good relationships and must be friendly.</li>
                    <li>Rigid chains of command affect the working condition negatively.</li>
                    <li>A good working condition has a very good effect on employee’s productivity of Diamond Bank Plc, Nigeria.</li>
                </ul>
