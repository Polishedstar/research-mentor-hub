            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research work was summarized based on the findings presented and analyzed in chapter four. The research work established that there are negative effects of examination malpractices.</p>
                <p>This research finding also shows that inattentiveness in class is the major challenge to examination malpractice in Plateau State Polytechnic.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the research finding also shows that examination malpractice is prevalent in tertiary institutions.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that there are different forms of examination malpractices which are practiced during examinations. These include bringing unauthorized materials to the examination hall, sending prepared answers to students by teachers and parents, impersonation, collusion of school teachers with examiners to assist students, question and paper leakages, cheating among students, cheating directly from textbooks, attempting papers outside the examination halls, and script changing.</p>
                <p>The results of the study also explored various factors that contribute to examination malpractices, such as corruption, threats to supervisory staff by students and parents, parental pressure for securing high marks, poor implementation of examination rules, collusion of school authorities with examiners, school pressure for good results, no fear of punishment, inadequate preparation for examinations, misuse of computers and mobile devices by students, poor invigilation, disloyalty of examination bodies, allotment of examination duties against merit, gift culture, and a lack of care for supervisory staff. Other factors include fear of failure, poor morale and economic depression of supervisory staff, poor daily allowances and facilities for supervisory staff, a poor teaching-learning process, a lack of teaching staff, and overscheduled involvement in co-curricular activities.</p>
                <p>Examination malpractice is an act or irregular manner of testing examiners that contravenes the rules and conventions guiding the conduct of examinations. The causes could be attributed to the behavior of examiners, parents, and the system. The consequences could be catastrophic, as both the educational system and society would produce certificated illiterates.</p>
