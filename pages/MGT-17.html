            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study became necessary with the main objective to determine the indispensability of advertising in our contemporary society. In the present contemporary world of business, governance and other fields of human endeavor, advertising, like any other management, behavioral, and social sciences as well as the liberal arts, can hardly be properly practiced or managed without adequate research and evaluation.</p>
                <p>The study gave credence to the postulation of Nwosu and Nkamenbe (2006) that advertisements are crafted to appeal to the intended audience. This requires that the audience must be predicted, or at least, approximated. This requirement is predicated upon the imperative of the advertiser to understand the psychology of the audience. Advertising without a target audience in mind is like a ship without destination; most of the time and money spent on such advertisement is wasted. These requirements in developing advertisements point to the imperativeness of research in understanding consumers and their needs before actually developing advertising materials.</p>
                <p>It has also provided the requisite impetus critically vital to the growth and development of the advertising industry in the country. The study revealed the necessity of advertising, showing how consumers are influenced by many factors in making their marketing decisions.</p>
                <p>Applying the right instrumentality and appropriate research method, using structured questionnaires to elicit the views and opinions of consumers, the work attempted to ascertain the disposition of consumers towards advertising generally as well as their perception of advertised products.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that the main purpose of advertising is the creation of awareness and the inducement of sales in the long run. It observed that advertising should focus attention on its reach. Talking of reach, the study identified the various roles of the various types of media used for advertisement campaigns. It observed that different media had different characteristics. For instance, it was observed that while the television enjoyed a lot of viewership due to its advantages of audio/visuals, the radio, on its part, enjoyed listenership as it has a wider reach and could cover a wider geographical area. The print medium enjoyed a more or less readership. This obviously could be as a result of the poverty level in the country generally.</p>
                <p>Generally, advertising was described as a powerful marketing communication tool and a superior promotional tool with some distinct capabilities. However, the importance of advertising cannot be overemphasized in the present-day business activity. This development is traceable to the paradigm shift from the product concept, which focuses on the production of products alone with the hope that consumers will come for them. The emphasis now, however, is that you have to make your product known to consumers and as well, convince them why they should patronize the product. This is the new marketing concept which recognizes the consumer as the "King".</p>
