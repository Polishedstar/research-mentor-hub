            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>An entrepreneur is an individual who has the ability to see and evaluate business opportunities, gather the necessary resources to take advantage of them, and initiate appropriate action to ensure success.</p>
                <p>Aside from the motive of success alongside the profit maximization syndrome, they ought to be knowledgeable about the contributory aspects of entrepreneurship roles in nation-building, which will serve as a guide to anyone who wants to venture into any kind of business, having in mind the basic role it plays in the growth and development of the country.</p>
                <p>The above assertion emphasizes the general notion of entrepreneurship roles in nation-building, which to a large extent helps check the unemployment problems faced by the citizens of this country.</p>
                <p>Also, every business owner with a profit syndrome mentality and negligence of the role of their enterprise towards the growth and development of the country will result in product offerings to society without any impact felt by the citizens of that particular society.</p>
                <p>In the results, the business owners are cognizant of the fact that their product delivery will determine the extent to which its effect can be felt and, as such, determines the role it plays in nation-building.</p>
                <p>Hence, entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the growth and development of the country.</p>
                <p>The researcher, from their findings, made us understand that most business enterprises venture into the field of entrepreneurship fully aware of the roles played by it in nation's building (growth and development), and the society is also cognizant of the role played by entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>It is an established fact that entrepreneurship roles are among the major determining factors for the nation's economic growth and development, such that any business enterprise cannot detach itself from the role played by its enterprises for the citizens.</p>
                <p>However, the attitude of the public towards any business enterprise can either positively or negatively affect the impact played by the enterprises. Many small-scale business enterprises are already cognizant of their role in the growth and development of the country despite the challenges posed by the populace.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, most business enterprises have realized that existence and success in business cannot be possible without making a positive impact on the populace of the society or the nation at large.</p>
