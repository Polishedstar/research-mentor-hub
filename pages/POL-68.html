            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the study, one could summarize that the problem of effective utilization of revenue available to local government, in particular, Aninri local government as a case study is not in the hands of the federal and state government, but in the hands of those in the council, especially those entrusted with the local government revenue.</p>
                <p>On the problem that hinders the effective utilization of revenue available to local government, it was deduced from the data collected that general laxity on the part of the finance department tops the list of the problems that hinder revenue utilization. In this case, it means that the finance department and those entrusted with the revenue of the local government are not strict with the regulations when it comes to handling the local revenue.</p>
                <p>The collected and analyzed data revealed that the level of development in Aninri local government is unsatisfactory. Though the actual revenue is not up to the estimated revenue, the available revenue is not utilized to provide the basic amenities for the indigenes of Aninri local government, such as good roads, electricity, pipe-borne water, etc.</p>
                <p>It was identified that the utilization of the revenue available to Aninri local government has produced a negative impact on its indigenes. It has led to underdevelopment in Aninri local government. There are no local industries where the indigenes of Aninri can be gainfully employed, and the standard of living of the people of Aninri local government is very low.</p>
                <p>According to the interview carried out by the researcher on one of the staff of Aninri local government, he was of the view that, though the money is coming, both the statutory allocation and the internally generated revenue, before the revenue gets to the implementation stage, the revenue will be inadequate due to embezzlement of the revenue by top officials.</p>
                <p>Misplaced priority also hinders the utilization of revenue of the local governments. The revenue allocated and generated by local government are always misplaced and mismanaged. As one of the findings of this study, priorities are misplaced, and projects are done not according to or as demanded by the people.</p>
                <p>The researcher also found out that lack of accountability constitutes a problem for the effective utilization of local government revenue, along with poor leadership, corruption, a poor electoral body at the local level, late release of funds from the state government, and inadequate skilled personnel. All these problems hinder the effective utilization of revenue available to local governments.</p>
