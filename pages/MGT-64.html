            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The aims and objectives of this research work are to determine the ways by which collective bargaining contributes to the effectiveness of an organization as well as analyzing the reaction of employees and employers of labor on conflict.</p>
                <p>This study revealed that collective bargaining is a very important factor in ensuring industrial peace and harmony among workers, which results in an increase in productivity, profit, and the overall performance of the organization.</p>
                <p>This study also established that collective bargaining should be embarked upon in organizational conflict resolution because it is a process in which the management and employees' representatives meet and negotiate the terms and conditions of employment for mutual benefit.</p>
                <p>The study further revealed that the processes adopted in conflict resolution were adequate and appropriate, hence the growth of the organization.</p>
                <p>The results obtained from the findings showed that quite a number of people strongly believe that collective bargaining should be used in reducing organizational conflicts.</p>
                <p>The findings of this study confirm that collective bargaining is an effective tool for conflict resolution in any organization. This is so because for an organization to prosper, the human resource is the most important aspect of any organization. But there is a need for trust between union and management. As there is an attitude change toward collective bargaining of union and management, it is due to misconceptions and confusions about the system as well as the negligence of the management.</p>
                <p>However, there are some factors, if they are implemented properly, then any organization can have effective collective bargaining that is necessary to become an effective organization. As the study shows, there is a severe need for mutual trust in the organization and proper communication. The absence of these factors brings about confusions and misunderstandings between union and management.</p>
