            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
            <!DOCTYPE html>
                <p>The research work focuses on the impact of distribution in the marketing of consumer products, with a case study of Nasco Food Plc. Through the study, we have identified the existing distribution channels used by Nasco Foods Nigeria Plc to reach consumers. We have also identified constraints associated with the distribution channel structure and provided solutions to the identified constraints.</p>
                <p>Efforts were made to determine if management was giving due attention to physical distribution and other distribution logistics. The study established the importance of a well-structured distribution channel and how it contributes to rapid product growth.</p>
                <p>Various literature on the impact of distribution on the marketing of consumer products was reviewed. Data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive tools.</p>
                <p>The results show that Nasco Food's distribution system has an impact on the marketing of its products.</p>
                <p>In the analysis carried out, several questionnaires were used, and the responses obtained revealed the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The distribution channels adopted by Nasco encourage aggressive selling practices.</li>
                    <li>The distribution strategy helped in facing competition challenges in the market.</li>
                    <li>The benefits of distribution of their products justify the cost incurred into it.</li>
                    <li>Nasco has a problem in distributing their products to all potential consumers.</li>
                    <li>There is a problem with financing the distribution of their products.</li>
                    <li>The distribution strategy of Nasco helps the organization to handle potential competitors.</li>
                    <li>Nasco's distribution system has contributed to the success of the organization.</li>
                    <li>The distributors are satisfied with the distribution strategy of Nasco.</li>
                    <li>The distribution of Nasco encourages customers to purchase their products.</li>
                    <li>In addition, the distribution channel Nasco Food Company provides efficient information on the products' marketability.</li>
                    <li>Several problems have been encountered when purchasing Nasco products, which may be as a result of poor distribution channels.</li>
                    <li>The cost of their products increased as a result of extra charges on delivery agents which were not initially by the company.</li>
                </ul>
