            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>A fundamental principle undergirding the design of modern governments is that of the separation of powers. However, this research work has stated that the doctrine of separation of powers can only function properly where there is an interplay of checks and balances. By this interplay, the fiction is that each arm shall be autonomous within its own sphere. This is a fiction properly so-called because the three arms of government are by the constitutional framework expected to operate an overlapping system of administration. Each must carry on in a manner that is complimentary to and not subversive of the other two towards peace and good government. This practice, however, is fraught with challenges in Nigeria. This research work has addressed these challenges. In the course of this study also, the researcher has established the roles each arm of government plays in checking the activities of the others.</p>
                <p>Equally, the researcher has posited that members of the executive and legislative organs of government pledge their loyalties to their respective parties and not to the electorates to the detriment of the citizens. It is in light of this that the researcher submits that, in spite of structural deficits and some other problems, constitutionalism still holds a better prospect for political stability in Nigeria, if the factors that promote these challenges can be attenuated.</p>
                <p>In the course of this essay, the researcher found the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Among the three arms of government in Nigeria, the one that looks most institutionalized to carry the tottering weight of the other two is the judiciary. It has been observed that this arm of government has been a victim of systemic and systematic abuse orchestrated by the other organs of government. The judiciary has also been denied of its financial autonomy, and judges the subject of frequent intimidation by politicians. This is done to make judges puppets or to deal with the judiciary where judgments do not go in their favor.</li>
                    <li>It has also been found that while carrying out their constitutional duties, the executive and legislature constantly accuse each other of attempting to take over the responsibilities of the other. This is usually frowned at and most times lead to a long battle for supremacy. The controversy that surrounded the 2016 Appropriation Bill is instructive on this.</li>
                    <li>As earlier noted, the executive has the constitutional power to appoint certain judicial officers on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council. The researcher has discovered that this process makes judges look like political appointees whom other arms of government expect to be their stooges as a payback for appointing them in the first place.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The importance of political parties in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized. Political parties are so important that no candidate can contest for a political office without first being a member of a political party and contesting under that party. However, experience has shown that political parties do not exert disciplinary and supervisory control over their elected members. They, in fact, lack strong ideological foundations and do not carry out frequent training for their elected members on the importance of the separation of powers.</p>
