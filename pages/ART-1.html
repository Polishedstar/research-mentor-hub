            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study interrogated the relationship between economic diplomacy and foreign policy making and implementation in Nigeria with emphasis on the economic diplomacy of national economic empowerment and development strategy (NEEDS). Africa’s week economics in the present global order are trapped from growing in view of external influence on her economies and policies by advanced capitalist economies. In this process, the reform package of the national economic empowerment and development strategy was inspired by apologists of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as the viable development model. In fact, its implementation could not jumpstart the Nigerian economy. Some analysts argue that the reform package of liberalization, deregulation, devaluation seems to have failed to revamp Nigeria’s ailing economy through the attraction of foreign direct investment and therefore recommend another proactive foreign policy. Others argued that deregulation, devaluation, and monetization have instead of reducing poverty and unemployment exacerbated it. Many of them were unable to engage in an analysis of the national economic empowerment and development strategy.</p>
                
                <p>Based on the lacuna in the extant scholarship, we interrogated the following research questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Has the economic diplomacy of national economic empowerment and development strategy reduced the incidence of poverty in Nigeria?</li>
                    <li>Has the economic diplomacy of national economic empowerment and development strategy reduced the incidence of unemployment in Nigeria?</li>
                    <li>Did the economic diplomacy of national economic empowerment and development strategy increase the volume of foreign direct investment from advanced capitalist economies to Nigeria?</li>
                    <li>Was the economic diplomacy of the national economic empowerment and development strategy responsible for the debt relief extended to Nigeria by the international financial institutions?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The above questions enabled us to arrive at the following hypotheses below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Economic diplomacy of the national economic empowerment and development strategy did not reduce the incidence of poverty in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Economic diplomacy of the national economic empowerment and development strategy did not reduce the incidence of unemployment in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Economic diplomacy of the national economic empowerment and development strategy increased the volume of foreign direct investment from advanced capitalist economies to Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Economic diplomacy of national economic empowerment and development strategy was responsible for the debt relief extended to Nigeria by international financial institutions.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>These hypotheses were interrogated in chapters three to six of this study, while chapters one, two, and seven dwelt on introduction, foreign policy making and implementation in developing states, and conclusion respectively.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter two demonstrated that there is a nexus between economic diplomacy and foreign policy making and implementation. It established the fact that while foreign policy is the substantive aspects of external relations, diplomacy is the procedural aspects. Chapter three and four ratified the impact of economic diplomacy of the national economic empowerment and development strategy on poverty reduction and unemployment generation in Nigeria. We observed in this process that the economic diplomacy of the national economic empowerment and development strategy, instead of reducing poverty and unemployment in Nigeria, exacerbated it to an alarming proportion.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter five traced the influence of the reform package of the national economic empowerment and development strategy as it relates to liberalization, deregulation of the downstream sector of Nigeria's oil economy, Privatization, and commercialization. It discovered that although the national economic empowerment and development strategy significantly enhanced the inflow of foreign direct investment from advanced economies to Nigeria, it benefits them more because our domestic goods could not withstand the competition from their manufactured goods that flood and find solace in the Nigerian market.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter six discovered that the national economic empowerment and development strategy was implemented in accordance with the reform conditionality of the International Monetary Fund through devaluation, deregulation, and monetization. The impact was the attraction of debt relief to Nigeria from the International Monetary Fund through the process of debt repudiation, conciliation, and forgiveness.</p>
