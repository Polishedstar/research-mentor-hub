            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This work throws more light on the impact of the economic environment on business activities in the state. It has been realized that it has both positive and negative impacts on business.</p>
            
                <p>However, the business environment encompasses the climate or set of conditions, economic, social, political, or institutional in which business operations are conducted. The business environment also contains internal and external factors. The internal factors create opportunities and threats to the business, including socio-economic conditions, technology, and political conditions. The business environment is a mixture of complex, dynamic, and uncontrollable external factors within which a business operates.</p>
            
                <p>When examining the economic impact on business, it was discovered that it is influenced by the entire economy, which can be affected by various situations such as political, social, and cultural factors in the state.</p>
            
                <p>Due to changes in the economy, including price increases, irregular supply of goods, and shifts in consumer behavior, many people no longer patronize certain businesses. The business environment plays an important role in all business enterprises, helping business people understand the internal environment, economic system, and market conditions. Knowledge of market structure and changes is vital for businesses to adapt to fluctuations in demand, supply, government participation in business, and other factors.</p>
            
                <p>This research examined the economic environment, which includes both the macro business environment (uncontrollable external factors affecting business) and the micro-business environment (controllable factors).</p>
            
                <p>The role of the economy in business is to ensure that goods or products sold are of good quality and not adulterated. It also regulates the pricing of commodities to protect individuals and society from unethical practices.</p>
            
                <p>In conclusion, this research work highlights the importance of clear understanding and communication between marketers and consumers for the smooth operation of business activities.</p>
