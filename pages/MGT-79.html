            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>After a thorough empirical analysis of data collected for this research, this research discovered the following among others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Television advertisement brings about an increase in sales volume. This is the reason major companies spend a huge amount of their earnings on television advertisements.</li>
                    <li>It was also discovered that television advertisement creates brand loyalty. This explains why some consumers will use an alternative product or service because they have become accustomed or addicted to such products or services.</li>
                    <li>Other findings are that television advertisement is more consumer-friendly because they get to see the usage of the product or service, unlike other means like radio, where you only hear, and newspapers, where prospective clients only read about such products or services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Television advertisement, since its inception in the early sixties, has enjoyed tremendous growth than any other form of advertisement. This is because of its dual feature - audio and visual. Television advertisement will continue to take its place as the foremost medium of reaching prospective clients due to its convincing nature. For any organization to stay afloat, it must, at one point in time or the other, engage the use of television advertisement.</p>
