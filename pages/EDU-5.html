      <br><br><h1>EDU-5: Effects of Parental Influence on Choice of Career among Secondary School Students in Jos North LGA</h1>

                <p>This study has dealt with the effect of parental influences on the choice of career among secondary school students in Jos North Local Government Plateau State. This study has thrown light into the misconception among secondary school students about the factors that determine their choice of career. It also revealed that all the selected secondary schools in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State lacked the service of a career counselor which has made the students in that area to be one-sided in their choice of career and their parents are looking towards a prestigious career for their offspring. In the course of this research, it was discovered that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Parents, as one of the environmental factors, generally wish their children to achieve where they have failed and stated that there is a need for parents, teachers, government, and the students to take career choice very seriously as this will determine whatever the child will become in the future.</li>
                    <li>Students chose a career without considering the factors that influenced career choice such as the issue of poverty, family income level, and the issue of marriage. Change has become a constant force for both at work and in life outside of work. However, change often brings opportunities, flexibility, versatility, and adaptability during transitional times, which can be the keys to career-building success.</li>
                    <li>A great number of students indicated their interest in prestigious careers like Medicine, Law, and Engineering instead of those that match their personality type. Previous researches also confirmed that many students are still ignorant of not only subject combinations that lead to their career but also the type of personality that fits their career. Probably, this was why almost all the students took prestigious careers that are mismatch for their personality types. Analysis of the composite scores of environment, opportunity, and personality shows that students believed personality affects their career choice the most.</li>
