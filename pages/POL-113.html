            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study has examined the causes and effects of ethnic-religious conflict escalation in Jos North Local Government Area and its implications for national integration. It is pertinent to provide a summary of the major findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a significant correlation between ethnic-religious conflict management and national integration. This is evident in areas such as peace, corporate existence, socio-economic development, and effective policy implementation throughout the state.</li>
                    <li>Government and security agents have performed poorly in addressing critical problems associated with ethnic-religious conflicts in Plateau State. Approximately 72.8% of the findings indicate ongoing attacks in many communities, despite government and security agents' efforts.</li>
                    <li>Ethnic-religious conflicts have threatened peaceful coexistence and sustainable development in Jos North Local Government Area. About 76% of the findings reveal that various crises hinder harmonious relations between Christians and Muslims in Plateau State, particularly in Jos North Local Government Area.</li>
                    <li>Multiple factors are responsible for the frequent ethnic-religious conflicts in Jos North Local Government Area, including indigene-settler issues, political participation/representation, Islamization agendas, economic control by the Hausa-Fulani, ownership, indigenship, and migration, among others.</li>
                    <li>Government, community leaders, and NGOs have adopted various strategies to manage ethnic-religious conflicts effectively in Jos North. These strategies include security forces deployment, peace initiatives like summits and conferences, youth sensitization, mediation, conciliation, negotiation, and bargaining.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>However, the findings also indicate that about 53% of these measures have not been effective, as evidenced by the frequent and continuing crises in Jos North and Plateau State as a whole.</p>
