            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It is obvious that no matter how perfect a research has been designed and implemented, if the results are not effectively communicated to the person responsible for using them to make decisions, the research project is a failure (Hair, Bush, and Ortinau, 2003).</p>
                <p>The time, effort, and money that went into marketing research can only be justified with the research report if it is effectively designed and implemented. From the analysis of this research, it was discovered that NASCO Form of Companies Nigeria Limited, Jos, has a good marketing research department which seems to be improving the success of the company despite the economic recession being experienced globally.</p>
                <p>It was also established that the problems of the companyâ€™s products that research is being taken upon can be communicated to the public, especially its customers and distributors.</p>
                <p>Finally, it was realized scientifically that NASCO is one of the largest manufacturing organizations on the plateau which has very good marketing research policies and strategies aimed at enhancing a good image in the profitability of the entire organization.</p>
                <p>From the interpretation and analysis of the findings of the research, it is evident that marketing research is the life wire of any business organization in existence. Therefore, the impact of marketing research on the survival of business cannot be over-emphasized since it increases sales volume and creates marketing opportunities, which then increases patronage of products.</p>
                <p>In other words, the survival of any business organization today depends solidly on the well-being of marketing research policies of such organization. Thus marketing research has a very positive effect on the survival of any business though concrete and scientific proof in NASCO Group of Company.</p>
