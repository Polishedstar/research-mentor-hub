            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focuses on the Impact of Local Government Service Commission on the socio-economic and administration of local government in Plateau State, with a case study of Local Government Service Commission, Plateau State. The following are the summary of findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The findings revealed that Local Government Service Commission has an impact on the socio-economic and administration of the Local Governments in Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>That the Commission contributed immensely to the growth and development of the socio-economic of Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>That efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of local government enhance goals and the achievement of objectives.</li>
                    <li>However, there are some shortfalls noticed in the commission's administration, which are a lack of supervision and political interference that affect the commission negatively in the discharge of the statutory responsibility in the Local Government.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is obvious that for the local governments to perform their duties and responsibilities, there must be coordination and supervision from the Local Government Service Commission. This will checkmate the activities of the Local Government, thereby giving room for effective management and administration.</p>
                <p>Local Government Service Commission has contributed a lot to the socio-economic development of Nigeria and administration of Local Government, having performed the statutory function greatly in the appointment, coordination, administration of policy, and implementation in the Local Government.</p>
