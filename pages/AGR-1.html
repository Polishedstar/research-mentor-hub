            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
            <p>The main objective of this study was to find out the impact of GPAP project on farmers’ production efficiency. The analysis of such an impact was conducted and conclusions herein are based on the findings. This study started from the concerns expressed by stakeholders with regarding to the low levels of agricultural productivity, where agriculture was seen as one of the important sectors to develop the rural economy; it was therefore considered essential to establish the actual impact of the project on farmers’ production efficiency. The study focused on case studies, typical evaluations of farmer groups and extension staff that were involved in the project.</p>

            <p>The overall aim of this study was twofold; firstly, the study analysed and established the extent to which capacitating of extension staff would impact on the farmers’ agricultural productivity, secondly it investigated whether training farmers themselves would have better success rates in their agricultural enterprises. The study endeavours to shed more light on the critical determinants of low implementation of project activities associated with low commitment of extension staff, drought, and lack of labour. In summary, the background of the study is from the ARC-GCI which established a working partnership with the Limpopo Department of Agricultural extension service. Under the auspices of Jos South, the GPAP was created and implemented in different districts of the Jos South LGA.</p>

            <p>Through the GPAP farmer groups were formed and capacitated. Extension officers seconded to the project were also capacitated to implement the project through onfarm trials and demonstrations. Therefore the main aim of the study is to analyse the impact of the project and to identify factors that affected implementation negatively.</p>

            <h3>The specific objectives of the study were:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Review key implementation tools and their appropriateness to farmers during the implementation of the project.</li>
            <li>Investigate the level of farmers’ participation in the implementation of the project through mobilisation of farmer groups and determine farmer’s performance indicators and levels of productivity.</li>
            <li>Investigate factors and underlying causes of poor implementation or failure to adopt recommended technologies by farmers.</li>
            <li>Determine the success of the program to capacitate extension staff to implement an intervention program on improved maize production to farmer groups.</li>
            <li>Determine the impact of the leadership development program presented to the Aganang leader farmer group.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Data were collected using a structured survey instrument which evaluated extension officers on the level of farmer participation, and impact of the project. Checklists were also used to assess the extent to which the project met farmers’ needs. Data analysis was limited to a summary of frequency tables and charts to determine the level of farmers’ participation in the project. Due to the limited number of respondents, data was not analysed empirically however a strong conceptual framework was used to analyse the data collected.</p>

            <p>The dissertation employed data/work from the University of Pretoria on training of extension officers, case studies of farmer mobilisation groups under the GPAP project. This Chapter holistically creates an understanding of how capacitating of extension staff is of great importance to farmer development and also screening of potential farmers could lead to successful farmer enterprises. There is no doubt that the GPAP program had a positive impact on farmers however in view of the purposeful approach to objectively address the research objectives; it is appropriate to summarise these findings. The following conclusions can be deduced from the entire results of the study.</p>
