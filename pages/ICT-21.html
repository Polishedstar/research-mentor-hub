            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work investigates the impact of computer-related hazards on the job performance of the secretary. The study discovered that computer technologies provide people with many benefits; educational activities can be designed; online shopping is available; it is possible to get in touch with people overseas and to chat with them; it is possible to search for anything; and sometimes, it is even possible to do one's job at home without going to his or her office. If these technologies, which dominate our lives more each passing day, are not used carefully, it is inevitable for people to end up with certain illnesses. More so, the use of computers has become more popular as like mobile phones and as a result, it provides some hazards to humans, which can be classified as physical and mental illness.</p>
                <p>The research work found that computers have increased the work performance of secretaries as it makes their work easier, faster, and more efficient. Computer applications such as Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and database management through electronic record management enable secretaries to manage documents with ease and access files easily.</p>
                <p>However, the constant use of computers results in many health-related problems. These illnesses have been found to include addiction, depression, headaches, back pain, arthritis, low sperm count, infertility through the use of laptops, obesity, among others. The study discovered that these problems greatly affect the performance of secretaries. As evident from scholarly findings, secretaries who have worked for a long period of time with computers end up having back pains, arthritis, infertility, constant headaches, vision problems, or sight problems, among others.</p>
