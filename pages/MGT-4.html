            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>
                    The study through the test of hypothesis (chi-square) accepts the H1 (Alternative) and rejects the Ho (Null) of the statement of hypothesis one, which states that Brand equity has an impact on consumer loyalty. The implication is that subscribers (customers) loyalty to a brand is due to the brand's owning value – real and perceived, rational and emotional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, table 6 shows that the competitive landscape of the telecommunication market is already changing the marketing strategy in the industry. Thus, it will be naïve of MTN (Market Leader) to expect a continuation of this state of affairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And most especially, MTN needs to know that as much as your brand equity gives you price premium (competitive advantage) in an industry like telecoms, it is only for a time. This is because as the number of offerings within a category multiplies, the differences between them start to become increasingly trivial, and loyalty to the best value replaces any previous loyalty to a brand.
