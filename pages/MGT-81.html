            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Modern-day marketing has greatly evolved. Companies now use consumer-driven approaches to further their abilities to satisfy the countless emerging needs and wants of the modern consumer. Amongst these consumer-driven approaches, branding has emerged as one of the crucial activities required in the building of a loyal customer base and the creation of an effective brand image.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to establish the impact branding has on consumer product choice, as well as determine how Coca-Cola, via the techniques of branding, affects consumer product choice. It has been found that there is indeed a correlation between the effects of branding and consumer product choice. Branding influences the process of learning, the creation of beliefs, and the formation of attitudes in various types of consumer purchasing behavior.</p>
                <p>However, it must be noted that there is also evidence to suggest that the four different types of consumer purchasing behavior, namely, the complex behavior type, dissonance-reducing buying behavior type, habitual buying behavior, and the variety-seeking behavior type, all exhibit different reactions to branding stimuli. Therefore, one can conclude that it is essential that marketers individualize the branding process in regards to these four types of consumer behavior in order to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>
                <p>In terms of how Coca-Cola uses branding to influence its consumer product choice, it has been found that Coca-Cola has chosen to focus on the meanings exhibited by brand benefits, brand values, and brand identity. This has effectively led to the domination of the beverage market.</p>
