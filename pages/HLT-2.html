            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It can be concluded from this study that the proportion of patients satisfied with the services in the outpatient clinics of Randle General Hospital, Surulere is 80.7%.</p>
            
                <p>When the convenience/accessibility of the clinics was assessed, 73.4% of respondents were satisfied, mainly contributed to by those satisfied with the hospital's location (93.6%), while the time they take to see the doctor was the most common reason for their dissatisfaction in this dimension, as only 46.5% of respondents rated the waiting time as satisfactory.</p>
            
                <p>The proportion of respondents satisfied with the physical environment was also found to be 80.9%, with the lighting of the waiting area being the most contributory subcomponent to patient satisfaction (91.9%), and the presence of drinking water in the waiting area being the least contributory (43.4%).</p>
            
                <p>The proportion of respondents satisfied with the delivery of care by hospital personnel was also found to be 87.0%, with the physician's attentiveness being the most contributory component to satisfaction (91.3%), while the ability of the patient to make treatment choices contributed the least to patient satisfaction (77.1%).</p>
            
                <p>Based on these findings, the hospital management can improve the quality of care by making efforts to reduce patient waiting time, making services simpler and easier to navigate for patients, providing drinking water in the patient waiting areas, and ensuring doctors give more opportunity for patients to participate in their own care. Satisfaction surveys should also be extended to inpatient care services and be conducted on a periodic basis for quality assurance.</p>
