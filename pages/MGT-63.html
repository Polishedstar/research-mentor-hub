            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of the study, some facts were established based on findings and the analysis of such findings. From the data presented in Table 1, drawn from responses to Question 1, 76% of the staff strongly agreed that quality control has an impact in maintaining product standards in the organization. Similarly, Table 2 determined that effective quality control satisfies customers' needs.</p>
                <p>It was also ascertained from Table 3 where 64% of the respondents were of the opinion that the turnover rate of an organization is determined by the significance of quality control. Likewise, in Table 4, the respondents confirmed that staff training in the organization has a very positive effect on product quality. As a matter of fact, personnel training is carried out predominantly by induction courses to acquaint them with the established standards. In Table 5, 98% agreed that it reduces the level of scrap value as well as minimizing the rate of wastage of materials used in producing a product.</p>
                <p>From the analysis, the two alternative hypotheses (H1) were accepted, while the null hypotheses were rejected. By accepting the alternative hypotheses, it is obvious that the success of any manufacturing firm depends on the quality control department, which requires sound scientific knowledge of principles and principles of processing, manufacturing, storage, and distribution.</p>
                <p>Achieving high quality does not happen by accident. The production process must be properly managed to achieve quality standards. To establish and run an effective quality control unit, the quality control manager requires managerial skills and a sound knowledge of science and technology.</p>
                <p>Quality has to be something that is considered from the very beginning and built into everything that a business or organization does. Planning carefully, monitoring your work, and constant re-evaluation and adjustment are all extremely important. You don't ensure quality by catching mistakes before they reach the customer. You ensure it by setting up a system in which you don't make the mistakes to begin with.</p>
