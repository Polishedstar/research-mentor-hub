            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <h3>Effect of Service Quality Dimensions on Patient Satisfaction</h3>
                <p>The study revealed that all the service quality dimensions have a direct effect on the satisfaction of the patients. Tangibility of service quality delivery accounted for 15.0% of the patients’ satisfaction with service delivery. Reliability of service quality delivery accounted for 34.5% of the patients’ satisfaction with service delivery, which was also significant. Responsiveness of service quality delivery also accounted for 11.2% of the customers’ satisfaction with service delivery. Assurance of service quality delivery accounted for 34.2% of the customers’ satisfaction with service delivery, while empathy of service quality delivery was the only variable that accounted for an insignificant negative value of 12.5% of the customers’ satisfaction with service delivery.</p>
            
                <h3>Patients Hospital Preference</h3>
                <p>It is worthy to note from the findings that the majority of the patients who participated in the study had varied reasons for the preference of a private hospital to that of the public. A vast majority of the patients who completed the questionnaire concluded that preference for a private hospital. Their need for quality of service delivery from the hospitals necessitated their choice for the private hospital as compared to the public health facilities.</p>
            
                <h3>Overall Satisfaction Level of Patients Who Patronize the Hospitals</h3>
                <p>The findings of the study revealed that service quality is an important antecedent of customer satisfaction as it has a major influence on customer satisfaction in the healthcare facilities in the Greater Accra Region. The findings revealed that the patients of the private hospitals overall were satisfied with the five service quality dimensions of the SERQUAL model as compared to the patients of the public hospitals. The patients revealed their highest satisfaction with the reliability as well as the tangibility of service quality delivery.</p>
