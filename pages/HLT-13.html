            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The summary of this research case study shows that:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a disagreement about whether there is a significant improvement in the policy of child adoption by the social welfare department of Jos North Local Government Area.</li>
                    <li>There was a majority agreement that there is no significant improvement in the policy of child adoption.</li>
                    <li>Ignorance is not always a contributing factor that makes people in the area not report cases that are likely to be taken up by the social welfare department in terms of child adoption.</li>
                    <li>Cultural practices and beliefs deter some people from reporting cases that need adoption.</li>
                    <li>The social welfare department has not done much to enlighten people on its role in child adoption.</li>
                    <li>The policy implementers have not carried out their responsibilities effectively to attract the attention of the inhabitants to encourage them to report cases related to adoption.</li>
                    <li>The Local Government's child adoption policy has not significantly affected the rural dwellers.</li>
                    <li>Social service workers have not been doing well enough to arouse the attention of local communities in child adoption practice.</li>
                    <li>The Local Government authorities have not invested significant human and material resources in social welfare services.</li>
                    <li>The majority of the inhabitants confirmed that their communities look at adoption from a positive perspective.</li>
