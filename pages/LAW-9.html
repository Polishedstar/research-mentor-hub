            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This research work was able to figure out that a prisoner is a fellow who has breached the stated laws of a society. Such a person is confined, as a punishment in prison, for a certain duration or period stipulated by the court of law.</p>
                <p>It also discovered that prison has been in existence in some part of Nigeria, and that before now, some communities have invented means for punishing their members who misbehaved or violated any law. Imprisonment being one of the means, offending members of the community were usually isolated from the rest of the society. They were isolated with the hope that their behavior will change upon release. The colonialists unified the various systems in operation in different communities into a formal way. Until the independence of Nigeria, the system was managed by Nigerians. The prison system is saddled with the responsibility of reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners, deterrence, retribution, and protection of the society.</p>
                <p>The system has recorded tremendous success, as reports revealed that a great percentage of persons who have been held imprisoned have, upon release, exhibited a reformed and rehabilitated character. Reports also show that prisoners, upon release, live a law-abiding life.</p>
