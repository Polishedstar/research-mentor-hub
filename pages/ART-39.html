            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Information and communication technology (ICT) today plays a very vital role in newsgathering, and its influence can be seen in all aspects of broadcasting. However, this study was motivated by the persistent controversy between print and radio newsgathering over issues of credibility and news. Several research questions were formulated to investigate the identified problem.</p>
                <p>A review of literature was conducted, covering a theoretical foundation, studies, and views on the impact of ICT on radio newsgathering. This effort clearly established information and communication technology as indispensable in newsgathering.</p>
                <p>The survey technology was adopted with the questionnaire as the instrument for data collection. Copies of the questionnaire were distributed to selected respondents in P.R.T.V. which constituted the population of the study. Data obtained from the retrieved questionnaire copies were subjected to simple tables and percentages. The tabulated data was properly analyzed against each of the research questions in chapter one. Findings from the study revealed that ICT is not completely reliable for radio newsgathering, and that ICT is still under-utilized in Nigerian radio.</p>
                <p>ICTs are not completely reliable for radio newsgathering. The internet largely contributes to the unreliability of ICT. Some information and news gathered from sources like the internet are not investigated before they are broadcast. News gathered is interpreted and written from the editor's perspective or perception of news.</p>
                <p>ICTs that aid newsgathering are utilized by Nigerian radio with an over-dependence on the computer for both local and foreign news. The Agency of Nigeria (NAN) provides news stories only to the radio stations that subscribe.</p>
                <p>No doubt, ICT is of benefit to radio news. This improvement is seen in the improved access to information and news it allowed journalists. ICT broke barriers that stand between the radio journalist and news. Though ICTs are used in Nigerian radio stations, they have only been minimally explored. The low investment in ICTs by station managers and entrepreneurs can be attributed to the weak economic base of radio stations and non-support for the IT sector.</p>
