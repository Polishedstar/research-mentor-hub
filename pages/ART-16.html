            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This chapter presents the summary of this study from chapter one to four with a view of comparing them in perspectives with existing knowledge and other investigations on the issue of newspaper preference, especially as it has to do with newspaper front page graphics. It also draws a conclusion from the findings made during the study and makes necessary recommendations to ensure that newspapers’ front page is given more attention by graphically and aesthetically beautifying the front page of daily newspapers.</p>
            
                <p>The chapter one of this study gave an overall background with insight into the concept of graphics and also highlighted the graphical elements that make up the pages of a newspaper. The chapter also discussed the statement of the problem, the objective of the study, research questions, and the scope of the study, among other aspects.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter two of this study identifies and defines major concepts of this study, reviews relevant literature, and references three empirical studies by different authors, which were considered relevant to this study. The empirical studies reviewed are: "The Use of Front-Page Picture(s) in Newspapers" (September 2009) by Jennifer Ehidimamen; "The Effect of Graphics on the Print Media (A case study of Osun Defender)" (January 2011) by Temitayo Odumakin; "Impact of Photographs on Magazine Cover Page: (A Case Study of Tell and Ovation Magazine)." Also, some of the concepts reviewed include Graphics and Graphics Design, Colour and Colour Combination, Pictures and Photographs, Newspaper Production Process, Type-face, and Layout, among others.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter three of this study presents the methodology adopted for this research work, discussing the research design, population of the study, sampling technique, method of data collection, and method of data presentation.</p>
            
                <p>A total of 200 respondents were selected through an available sampling technique, a nonscientific sampling method. The available sampling technique was used because this study focused on front page graphics and readers’ preference with particular focus on The Sun and The Punch newspapers. Therefore, for the researcher to get accurate information, free readers of newspapers at vendors were selected in Ikare-Akoko and Akungba-Akoko. However, the researcher could not access all the free readers at vendor stands in the two locations because the readers come to the newsstand differently whenever they like. The researcher only administered the questionnaire to free readers available at vendor stands in Ikare-Akoko and Akungba-Akoko during the period of this research.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter four presents the data gathered from the respondents and presents it in tables and figures for a clearer understanding of the findings. Consequently, findings showed that:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>The Punch newspaper front page graphics are better designed than The Sun newspaper.</li>
                    <li>The Punch newspaper front page color combination is more attractive to the readers than that of The Sun.</li>
                    <li>The Punch newspaper front page type-face (font) is more preferable to readers than that of The Sun newspaper.</li>
                    <li>The Punch newspaper’s front page layout is more attractive to the readers than that of The Sun newspaper.</li>
                    <li>The pictures used on the front page of The Punch newspaper mostly attract readers than the pictures on the front page of The Sun newspaper.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the respondents mostly prefer to buy and read The Punch newspaper than to buy and read The Sun newspaper.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the respondents believed that the front page graphics and design of The Punch newspaper contributed to the reason why they buy and read The Punch newspaper.</li>
                </ol>
