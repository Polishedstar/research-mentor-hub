            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was aimed at identifying the roles mediation plays in conflict management and peace studies, the link between mediation and conflict management and peace studies, and to find out whether mediation is an effective means of conflict management and peace building. This study was conducted using a questionnaire as the main data collection instrument. Accordingly, the study findings show that conflicts that have occurred in society today are as a result of a struggle for either the burgeoning economic opportunities that abound on earth in the form of mineral resources, a struggle for power, position, and misunderstanding, social differences, and conflicts of work and job descriptions in an organization.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that in the pursuance of enduring peace and stability in Jos South Local Government, all the affected parties as well as stakeholders have a role to play in mediation and conflict management.</p>
                <p>The study further viewed mediation as a broad and rapidly growing field. There are now many professional mediation associations, focusing on areas ranging from divorce mediation to public policy mediation. These associations generally seek to develop and improve the practice of mediation by developing ethical standards, by offering mediation training, and by promoting the use of mediation.</p>
                <p>Mediation is a broad and rapidly growing field. There are now many professional mediation associations, focusing on areas ranging from divorce mediation to public policy mediation. These associations generally seek to develop and improve the practice of mediation by developing ethical standards, by offering mediation training, and by promoting the use of mediation.</p>
                <p>Moore reviews a number of such mediation associations and their activities. Generally, mediation codes of ethics require the mediator to be neutral and impartial, to avoid conflicts of interest, to obtain informed consent for their involvement from the parties, to maintain confidentiality, to reject cases that are beyond their expertise, and to be truthful in advertising their services and fees. The various associations' codes vary in their specifics.</p>
                <p>Research into mediation theory and practice has led to a proliferation of high-quality mediation training programs. Moore describes some of the basic elements of mediator training programs, including applicant screening procedures, training formats and methodologies, instructor qualifications, and criteria to guide the would-be mediator in selecting a program.</p>
                <p>As the mediation field has developed, there has been an increasing trend in the public and judicial spheres toward using mediated negotiation as an alternative to more traditional means of dispute resolution. Legislation has been passed at the federal and state levels encouraging the use of mediation, and executive orders have also mandated the development of alternative dispute resolution procedures in U.S. government agencies where appropriate.</p>
                <p>Finally, Moore sketches five developments that must occur if mediation is to become even more widely utilized, and seven areas where the practice of mediation itself may be further developed. In order for mediation to be more widely used, the public must be better educated about it, more research into mediation needs to be done, mediation must be more fully institutionalized, mediation services must be more fully funded, and new applications for mediation must be discovered. Moore suggests seven such new areas of application: ethnic conflicts, intractable conflicts, violent conflicts, education for the development of nonviolent cultures, dispute systems design, public governance, and global environmental issues.</p>
