            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of this research work, apart from the fact that the bankers must adhere to the principle of lending in order to maximize bad debts in the bank, the researcher also discovered that bad debts do not arise from non-adherence by the bankers to the principles of lending. There are other effects such as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The job of management and recovery of bad debts should be assigned to staff that is educible to do the job on behalf of the bank. A staff that does not know the job quite well will perform poorly, thereby earning the bank more bad debts than bargained for.</li>
                    <li>Policies made by the government are another effect of bad debts. Sometimes, government policies make some customers default in paying their debt when the policies made by the government affect them unfavorably, even though the bankers, at the time of giving out such loans, have reasonable assurance that the customer is capable enough to pay back its debts at the stated time.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The researcher also found out in this study that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>As the amount of loans and advances increase, the provision for bad/doubtful debt also increases.</li>
                    <li>The percentage rate of increase in the provision for bad debts was more than that of loans and advances granted within the same period.</li>
                    <li>There is a positive relationship between the increase in loans and advances and the provision for bad and doubtful debt.</li>
                    <li>In the course of making a provision for bad and doubtful debts, the amount set aside for such provision has an effect on commercial bank activities.</li>
                </ol>
