            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Construction activities will continue to negatively impact our environment unless the concept of sustainability is fully implemented during building projects. It is believed that this study has contributed to the body of knowledge in this area, specifically by assessing the level of implementation of sustainability practices during the construction phase of building projects, which has been the main aim of this research work.</p>
                <p>The appraisal has provided meaningful insight into sustainability practices that are being implemented on building projects, as well as the drivers, barriers, and measures of improving its implementation in Akwa Ibom State. The main findings of this study revealed that choosing the right construction method for resource conservation and consideration of the client’s satisfaction are the key sustainability practices. It was discovered that the level of awareness of sustainability practices is high in the study area, and these practices are subconsciously implemented in building projects.</p>
                <p>The findings also revealed that regulation by the government plays a central role in driving the implementation of sustainability practices. Client’s resistance to change was, however, revealed to be the major barrier to its implementation. The study concluded that education and training programs for building professionals are needed to improve the implementation of sustainability practices in the study area. To this end, the recommendations submitted in this research are poised to assist building professionals and clients in implementing sustainability practices in their building projects.</p>
