            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the findings of the study titled "Impact of Child Labour on School Attendance and Academic Performance of Pupils in Public Primary Schools in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State," the following conclusions were drawn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The study found that school attendance of pupils exposed to child labor remained low in comparison to those who were not exposed. Many of the truant pupils in schools were those exposed to child labor. This low attendance may have adverse effects on their academic performance, potentially leading to school dropouts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pupils who were not exposed to child labor had academic advantages over those exposed to labor. This suggests that a significant number of pupils exposed to child labor may face challenges in terms of academic achievement, possibly leading to low academic performance and an inability to cope with future academic challenges in schools.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Female pupils had lower school attendance compared to their male counterparts. This implies that female pupils might experience a higher rate of school dropout, academic failure, and difficulties in coping with future academic challenges in schools.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
