            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the research conducted in Industrial Training Fund, the following summary is drawn:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a need for a manpower planning department in ITF, and there should be an improvement in the planning strategy of the organization.</li>
                    <li>The findings reveal that planning brings about development and awareness in the organization.</li>
                    <li>It is also clear from the findings that training, recruitment, and planning are important aspects of an increase in efficiency in the local government. Priority should be accorded to these variables.</li>
                    <li>The research study also reveals that the issue of personnel training with the initiative of ITF has continued to elude the people of the grassroots as the majority of them attest to the fact that they have never been sent for training in the ITF. It means that the government needs to improve in this area.</li>
                    <li>Deductions from the research have shown that the best way an organization can implement its objectives is through a multi-dimensional approach, which ranges from training and retraining of personnel, management contracts, through the existing departments, and through discipline.</li>
                    <li>In respect to the question of the indispensability and inevitability of the need for training in every organization, whether big or small, the majority of the respondents endorsed the need for training in Industrial Training Fund.</li>
                    <li>Irregular manpower planning has also been identified as another pointer to the achievement of efficiency in ITF. The belief is based on the premise that irregular training is ideal for working with the status quo. It, therefore, means that planning should be done based on the current need.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the research work has also shown that the best way in which planning should be carried out is through collective effort. This means everybody should be included in the planning process. Planning at the grassroots level should be all-inclusive.</li>
