            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study was conducted on the premise of understanding and developing organizational culture typologies in the Nigerian construction industry. In order to achieve the overall aim of the study, four objectives were formulated:</p>
            
                <h3>Objective 1: To identify the position of construction organizational culture studies in cultural theories from past research.</h3>
                <p>This objective was achieved using a literature survey. Upon review of extant literature, ideational and the social-cultural theories were the recognized theories.</p>

                <h3>Objective 2: To determine the culture of the Nigerian Construction Industry with respect to the Competing Value Framework.</h3>
                <p>The Competing Value Framework identified six dimensions that perfectly describe the effectiveness of an organization. Using the mean score ranking, organizational glue was the highly ranked dimension followed by criteria of success, management of success, management of employees, dominant characteristics, organizational leadership and strategic emphases. It is implied that most construction organizations emphasize on teamwork and the craving to succeed in business but do not concentrate on strategic issues.</p>
            
                <h3>Objective 3: To identify the critical factors for constructing organizational culture typologies</h3>
                <p>Forty-eight factors were identified from existing typologies, organizational theories, business management, and construction management studies through a critical review of extant literature.</p>
            
                <h4>6.2.4 Objective 4: To develop organizational culture typologies for the Nigerian Construction Industry</h3>
                <p>The stated objective was achieved by using factor analysis to further reduce the forty-seven factors into simpler forms. Forty out of the forty-seven factors identified in section 6.2.3 were exposed to factor analysis because seven factors had communality values less than .40. Four components were finally extracted using the Principal Component Analysis and these components were explained by thirty-two factors. Four typologies were extracted about the Nigerian Construction industry. These include Workplace Orientation, Business Orientation, System Orientation, and Group Orientation. These four typologies are connected to the internal (Workplace orientation, System orientation, and Group orientation) and external environment (Business orientation) of the construction organizations.</p>
