            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The contributions which product packaging has made to marketing industries and its impacts on consumers' purchasing decisions have developed the country's economy. Product packaging by industries in Nigeria is a good ground for development in the society as a choice.</p>
                <p>The research discovered that product packaging is a vital tool used to boost sales.</p>
                <p>It was confirmed that there is high demand for goods and services by consumers despite the high price of goods for any company that has a good strategic packaging style.</p>
                <p>It was also observed that companies tend to have low returns where there is a low or poor packaging system because there will be low or poor patronage.</p>
                <p>Product packaging plays a very vital role in consumers' purchase decisions because it attracts the customer's attention through good color design.</p>
                <p>In the course of this research work, the summaries of findings are based on the data presentation and analysis of data, which are presented in the form of frequency tables from the previous chapter. These findings include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It reveals that the role packaging plays in the consumer decision-making process cannot be overemphasized, as consumers often judge a product by its packaging.</li>
                    <li>It was confirmed that packaging plays a vital role in stimulating, retaining, as well as winning the interest of new customers to purchase a company's product. Companies that have been using effective packaging have witnessed a tremendous increase in sales.</li>
                    <li>The findings indicate that it is imperative for companies to design and package their products well. Their packaging should carry the company's name, logo, trademark, and so on.</li>
                    <li>It also indicates that failure to pay attention to packaging by companies will lead to poor and unpleasant consequences, such as the inability to achieve company goals, loss of goodwill, excess stock levels, low sales, and hence low profitability.</li>
                </ol>
