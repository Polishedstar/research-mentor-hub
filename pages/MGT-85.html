            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research work focused on the effects of motivation on business service efficiency using a case study of Plateau State Tourism Corporation. It was discovered that motivation plays a crucial role in ensuring that employees of an organization render the best of services in carrying out their assigned responsibilities, especially in a rapidly changing business environment.</p>
                <p>The role of motivation on business service efficiency has since been recognized by both employers as well as employees alike, cutting across both public and private sectors. Hence one major problem faced by employers of labor as a whole over the years has been the effectiveness of motivating the workers for effective service delivery.</p>
                <p>It was discovered that the lack of effective motivation of workers within the work environment over the years has been detrimental. Until recently, workers went about their work with nonchalance and without any sense of commitment given the near absence of motivational incentives.</p>
                <p>However, with effective motivational schemes evident in human resources management, on-the-job staff training schemes, bonus schemes, annual merit awards, as well as promotions, among several others, the organization is not only able to achieve its set goals and objectives but also able to render the best of services to ensure that customers receive value for their money. The data analyzed using chi-square also indicates that motivation plays a crucial role in ensuring business service efficiency.</p>
                <p>Effective human resources management is a function of the proper understanding of the motivational schemes, which boils down to human needs. Man, being a social and complex entity, has a great tendency to be inconsistent but very defensive when it comes to personal interest. For example, most employees express dissatisfaction with their pay but would rather stay than go elsewhere even if given a higher pay.</p>
                <p>Conclusively, the interest of the organization will be better served if the interests of the employees are given due consideration in the formulation and implementation of organizational goals and objectives. It is evident in the light of the findings of this research that an effectively motivated staff is better equipped to render the best of services even in different circumstances. A major reason for this is the positive correlation between motivation and job satisfaction.</p>
