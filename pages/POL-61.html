            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In undertaking this research, it was discovered from responses resulting from the questionnaires administered that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Motivation is necessary to boost employee productivity in any given organization. A clearly spelled out motivation goes a long way in determining productivity. Employees, no matter their cadre, require proper motivation for them to ensure the maximum attainment of the goals and objectives of an organization.</li>
                    <li>The problems observed to be present in organizations are brought into focus, some of which include poor remuneration, absence of research facilities, and the application of the wrong motivation tools, etc.</li>
                    <li>Participation of workers in the decision-making of employees.</li>
                    <li>Further effort was intensified towards identifying the different sources of motivation and their application. The objectives of the study include the creation of awareness as to what constitutes motivation, highlighting techniques through which employees can be encouraged to pursue their work diligently, efficiently, and loyally to curtail the case of the exploitation of human efforts.</li>
                    <li>Also, employees placed a premium on spirit, corporate culture, and congeniality and recognition, with money being lower on the scale.</li>
                    <li>Management of organizations, on the other hand, placed a greater emphasis on monetary factors, with training and recognition following well behind. This study, though constrained by a well sample size, shows a marked difference between employees and management as to what constitutes successful motivation. Both groups agree that motivation is significant in influencing performance.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Finally, the findings of this research work lead the researcher to infer that if staff are not motivated, productivity falls below standard, thus leading to a non-realization of organizational growth.</p>
                <p>The problem of motivating employees is a very complex issue, as noted by various theorists. What may not motivate one employee to perform may not motivate another to perform, even in the same profession, social and economic level. The fact remains the same: staff motivation is an approach towards improving productivity and organizational efficiency.</p>
                <p>The identification of poor job performance of a system should not automatically be diagnosed as a motivation deficiency. More often than not, the absence of other factors than motivation is responsible for a drop in productivity. This is so because motivation is a function affecting performance directly. On average, from responses gathered, one could conclude without fear of contradiction that a clearly laid down policy of employee motivation, as well as proper planning and control of manpower or human resources, is a sure way of preparing the organization towards future productivity.</p>
                <p>Finally, in the course of this research, one is made to understand that every manager has a philosophy of how motivation is to be applied. However, very few attempt to articulate those philosophies so as to make the first step in the right direction.</p>
