            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the findings, the research identified the factors that influence the performance of project management consultants/practitioners on projects in Nigeria. The influencing factors which are identified are categorized into five groups which include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Factors related to the project</li>
                    <li>Factors related to the project manager and the team members</li>
                    <li>Factors related to the organization</li>
                    <li>Factors related to the external environment</li>
                    <li>Factors related to work conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since the aim of this research is to improve project management services in Nigeria's construction industry, findings in this research assert that these factors perceived as most influential lead to better performance within construction industries and they are likely to improve the performance of project managers. Consensus expert opinions were used to identify the most needed influencing factors to take into account when considering how to improve project management services in Nigeria's construction industry.</p>
                <p>Construction sector is seen as the pivot on which every other activity in the economy rotates on. The significant importance of this sector is evidenced in the fact that every business or services of diverse kinds must have a shelter and a location in the environment. Therefore, any effort towards reducing or eliminating the noticeable and silent constraints that directly or indirectly affect project management success in this sector is a right step in the right direction. The stakeholders in any complex building construction project are numerous and varied with parochial objectives different from the main objectives of realizing the cost, time, quality, and materials targets of the proposed construction projects. Proper project management policy, we believe, is the only solution to make sure that building construction and developments do not fail, collapse, or are abandoned at an alarming rate in Nigeria, as it threatens the foundation of economic growth and diminishes the chances of realizing the Vision 20:2020 project of the federal government.</p>
