            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The researcher's findings of this research work are that performance appraisal does affect workers' productivity. Our findings and conclusions are arrived at by the analysis of issues and responses from respondents in tables 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of Chapter four (4). The issues raised on these tables were the issue of motivation, rewards allocation, perception, employee's needs (training and development, and setting of objectives).</p>
                <p>For any organization, government agency, university, charitable organization, etc., to reach its goals effectively and efficiently, ways of accurately measuring the performance of its workers must be found and implemented. A good appraisal system is so fundamental to the management of people in any organization that it must not be ignored, as the success of the organization itself depends on a good appraisal system (Ubeku, 1975:13).</p>
                <p>It is therefore important that the management of organizations realize that they are not only dealing with the future of individual human beings who make up the organization but the organization itself.</p>
