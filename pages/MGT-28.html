            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study revealed that youths require robust ICT skills beyond the ones they have in the area of teaching and learning in order for them to make a global impact in the digitally transformed economy. This is in line with the findings and recommendations of Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2003) that identified ICT literacy as a critical skill component of the 21st century and described ICT literacy as the ability to define, access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create, and communicate information. As a major driver of the economy, ICT has become the most sought-after skill-set for the 21st century. Having identified in several studies and their recommendations the important role ICT-compliant skills play in preparing youths for the challenges of the 21st century; Agumuo (2007), OluObafeini (2015), Duruamaku-Dim (2014), Anireh and Amadi (2017), Anireh (2017), it behooves the institutions of higher learning to prepare Business Education students with the digital skills they will need to fulfill their roles in society.</p>
                <p>Sawyer (2006) discovered that most youths were not learning the deep knowledge that underlies knowledge work or lack instructional approaches to deliver the new skill sets required for 21st-century education (Ukpong, 2016 & Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2007). Deep learning (knowledge) rather than surface knowledge are the building blocks towards developing critical and creative thinking skills required for problem solving. Okirido (2016) drew attention to the most pressing demands in the field of ICT which he considered to be the determination of what constitutes adequate preparation for new types of positions available in a business world of data processing, information computer technology, and globalization.</p>
                <p>It is appropriate to begin to examine how adequate the training and skills-sets of ICT youths are endowed with in the 21st century. It will be crucial to start shifting attention and focusing discussions on a new set of courses that will help propel youths into the mainstream of work engagement and entrepreneurship. Courses like ICT literacy/digital skill compliance need to be properly integrated into the school's curriculum and other schemes of things.</p>
                <p>According to Gary (2017), our education and career systems need deep changes to prepare us for digital globalization. Globalization, which is simply the efficient movement of goods, money, information, and people across borders, is in many respects a byproduct of other changes. The digital revolution, like other previous revolutions, requires orientation, re-orientation, education, training, and retraining of youths and workforces with the new skill-sets that drive society into the new era. The drivers of today's economy are connectivity and automation, enabled by the massive technological revolution that is underway by way of an increasingly global, mobile, and intelligent internet.</p>
                <p>Another dimension to this, according to Gary (2017), is that if we do not come to grips with this widespread and high-velocity shift from essentially "doing the work" to "creating, organizing, and supervising," the situation stands to be worsening with the next wave of innovation (revolution) accompanied by AR (artificial intelligence), 5G Network marries mass global connectivity with big-data analytics. These are likely to disrupt traditional business models and industries even more than the digital revolution, accelerating an upstream movement in the labor force from administrative and manual workers to professional trades and knowledge workers. Our educational system has to be adjusted to enable us to address the skill-set needs for the widespread and high-velocity shift from essentially "doing the work" to "creating, organizing, and supervising (business development innovation).</p>
