            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the presentation and analysis of data, several findings have been made. The summaries of findings are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The achievement of organizational goals is possible only with effective leadership. Effectiveness depends on good planning and direction of both human and material resources to attain organizational goals and objectives.</li>
                    <li>The study also discovered that conflict is inevitable in any organization where there is human interaction. Therefore, management should address it promptly when it occurs.</li>
                    <li>Conflict may affect organizational productivity either positively or negatively. It is essential for management to manage conflict through effective dialogue, conciliation, mediation, and arbitration within the organization.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is evident that conflict situations occur in all organizations, involving subordinates, supervisors, and workers on the same grade. Effective leadership is needed to provide a conducive working environment to enable workers to achieve maximum efficiency. Conflict is inevitable in human interactions, and organizations must improve their leadership abilities to manage conflict and reduce its frequency and negative impacts in public organizations in Nigeria.</p>
