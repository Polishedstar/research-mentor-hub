            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the results obtained from the presentation and analysis of data collected from the respondents, the following were discovered:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Training and development have an impact on organizational performance. Neglecting training and development affects the Industrial Training Fund, Jos, and employees are trained to ensure they are productive.</li>
                    <li>Employees need to undergo on-the-job training. Organizations have low productivity due to the lack of on-the-job training. On-the-job training exposes employees to hidden potentials of the job.</li>
                    <li>The type of training delivery style used affects organizational performance. Training delivery style affects the understanding of the employees, and a lack of the proper training delivery style affects organizational performance.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A significant number of studies have been conducted in various industries and businesses over time, resulting in differing views on the effect of training and proposed solutions to improve employee performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the Impact of training and development on organizational performance in the Industrial Training Fund, Headquarters, Jos.</p>
                <p>The findings reported in this study suggest that training has an impact on the performance of employees concerning their jobs. This result is largely consistent with some of the literature widely available and also used for this research. To gain in-depth knowledge of this subject, questions focused on selection for training, participation in training, training design, training delivery style, and impact of the training on employee productivity were posed to employees using a questionnaire.</p>
                <p>Results show that when a systematic approach void of discrimination is employed in the selection of employees for training, it enhances performance. This implies that employees who need training have access to it, yielding improved results in their abilities to carry out required tasks effectively.</p>
                <p>Also, most of the respondents agreed that a good training design will increase the level of participation in trainings by employees. This will, in turn, ensure that the goal of trainings offered, which is to improve performance, is achieved. The delivery style of training programs is also an important factor to consider when employees are trained. Most of the respondents agreed that this factor is paramount in ensuring employees participate fully and complete training programs. It will also allow employees on different levels of intellect to gain the required knowledge from the training program.</p>
                <p>Based on the findings of the study, trainings are designed to attract, develop, motivate, and retain employees who ensure the effective functioning and survival of the organization. Employee performance is surely improved as a result of quality and consistent training as new skills are gained, skill gaps filled, and old skills sharpened. These also result in the subsequent success of the achievement of organizational goals and objectives. In conclusion, training has positive effects on organizational performance at the Industrial Training Fund, Headquarters, Jos.</p>
