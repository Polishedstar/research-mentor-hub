            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research objectives and research questions, which have all been addressed in the context of the life-cycle theory, play key roles in determining the research method and methodology and, by extension, the research results which are summarized below.</p>
            
                <p>The study reveals the following:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>The research reveals that the Nigerian mortgage market is influenced by the age and the position of individuals within the life-cycle. This conforms to the convention of previous research of Mariger (1987), Megboluge and Linneman (1993), and Detrich and Johannsson (2005). However, the negative effect of the working age on the mortgage market, which is implied in the results, does not conform to previous studies. Despite the fact that the results do not conform to previous studies, this research serves as the first research with documented evidence of a relationship of this manner in the Nigerian market. Furthermore, the non-conformity of the result to previous studies may be as a result of some peculiarity in the Nigerian mortgage market based on demographic and socioeconomic factors which may be investigated in further research. For instance, the mere fact that an individual is in a particular age group does not mean the individual is employed and thus may not increase mortgage demand. The high rate of unemployment, which is constantly rising, may also be responsible for this negative relationship. Down-payment constraint may further reduce the mortgage demand in proportion to the number of individuals in the working age group.</li>
                    <li>Approximately 93% of annual real estate development in Nigeria is residential real estate. This real estate development preference may arise from the perceived housing need in the nation which may be motivating developers to focus their resources in this sector. It may also be as a result of the desire of Nigerians to be homeowners which is consistent with the assertion of Ayedun and Oluwatobi (2011). This scenario thus implies that with the huge residential real estate supply-demand gap, and the preference of developers in this sector, investment potentials exist in this market, and with the right policies in place and a viable mortgage finance system, several benefits would accrue.</li>
                    <li>The preference for single room accommodation in the Nigerian residential real estate market is expressed by the fact that single room accommodation accounts for 60-70% of housing stock in Nigeria. This is despite the fact that the household size ranges between 4-5 individuals per household. This may be as a result of the low income levels as well as the high cost of renting better accommodation.</li>
                    <li>The study reveals that household disposable income may influence mortgage demand. However, the negative influence of household disposable income on mortgage demand in Nigeria (as revealed in the results conducted in Chapter Four) is not in conformity with majority of the previous scholars (Megboluge and Linneman, 1993; and Tin, 2000) who have discussed the effects of the household disposable income on mortgage demand in the context of the lifecycle theory. This result variation from previous studies may also be as a result of some peculiarity in the Nigerian mortgage market based on demographic and socio-economic factors which may be investigated in further research. For instance, an increase in household disposable income may encourage households to increase consumption rather than secure mortgage loans. Furthermore, an increase in household disposable income may encourage equity finance for some households especially considering the high and variable interest rates.</li>
                    <li>The mortgage market operates in an unfavorable and volatile national economy. This is consistent with Ben (2014) and Okonjo-Iweala (2014). This volatility and unfavorable environment is revealed in the fluctuating GDP growth rate, high and fluctuating inflation and interest rate, as well as the high and unstable exchange rate. For instance, the exchange rate has decreased by approximately 60% in the last ten years. The volatility expressed in the national economy has the potential to increase the risk of investment in this market and thus discourage further investment, further leading to a lower level of competition and high interest rates.</li>
                    <li>In connection to the broader scale macroeconomic influence on the Nigerian mortgage market, the results reveal that the interest rate may have a negative influence on the mortgage demand. The theoretical implication of this is that higher interest rates reduce affordability (Detritch and Johannson, 2005) which reduces the willingness of individuals to obtain mortgage facilities. Furthermore, the variability of interest rates may cause household consumption shocks which may further discourage further mortgage demand (Campbell and Cocco 2003). Thus, reduced interest rates may increase the performance of the Nigerian mortgage market.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>The significance of the research results and findings highlighted above is enormous. A major research gap which has been bridged is the revelation that the mortgage market in Nigeria is influenced by the age of individuals within the life cycle. This factor has hitherto been ignored in previous research on the Nigerian mortgage market. Additionally, the attempt of this study to utilize time series panel data to make analysis to determine factors influencing the mortgage market in Nigeria is a novelty of approach. The use of time series panel data has increased the accuracy of the inferences because the observations have been obtained over a long period of time. Thus, variation in time has been greatly accounted for in the analysis. Thus, the results in this research have a high level of reliability and accuracy.</p>
