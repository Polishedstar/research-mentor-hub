            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Recent studies in environmental design indicate a growing interest in user wayfinding and orientation in both familiar and unfamiliar public built environments. These human wayfinding studies have revealed the need for an integrated design system with wayfinding design as a critical component of the architectural design of the human habitat, particularly those spaces that fall within the public realm. Researching case studies on the subject, however, the study exposed the absence of an articulate wayfinding design system in the planning of public libraries in Nigeria; and using the National Library Umuahia as a conceptual model, it showcases the potentials for developing good wayfinding systems in Nigerian public libraries.</p>
                <p>By these findings, it is pertinent to alert all actors in the Nigerian built environment design â€“ clients, architects, urban designers, planners, and even graphic artists on the relevance to the creation of legible and user-friendly spaces of the application of wayfinding design strategies in the planning of library buildings. Also, further studies into relevant areas of cognitive science and human wayfinding would help develop more accurate local information needed in establishing local standards and guidelines for wayfinding design in Nigeria.</p>
