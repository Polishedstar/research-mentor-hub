            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the Data Analysis in the study, the following findings were revealed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a significant effect of organizational support on employee job satisfaction of selected deposit money banks in Plateau State, Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>There is a significant effect of reward on employee retention of selected deposit money banks in Plateau State, Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>There is a significant effect of training and development on employee productivity of selected deposit money banks in Plateau State, Nigeria.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>The essential focus of this project was to examine the impact of welfare services on employee performance of selected deposit money banks in Plateau State, Nigeria. From the proceeded study, it became apparent that employees are not lazy, they could be motivated to work efficiently and effectively if these welfare services are present, which will lead to an increase in performance.</p>
                <p>There should be an attempt to make sure that the employees are able to make certain of their own goals in the process of contributing to the achievement of the organizational goals. The employees could be motivated to work better for productivity if they know that there will be a reward for their performance. There will be no motivation if employees are not being encouraged by providing these welfare services.</p>
                <p>To motivate the employees, a good salary and other welfare packages should align internally and externally, and these will give rise to a better feeling in the employee that equity exists within the organization, and genuine motivation will increase performance.</p>
