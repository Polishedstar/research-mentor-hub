            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings in this study show:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Leadership has facilitated service delivery in the area of infrastructural development, such as construction/rehabilitation of roads and flyovers.</li>
                    <li>The government has contributed to poverty eradication programs to eliminate poverty in the state through employment and the establishment of new organizations.</li>
                    <li>Leadership has not influenced education positively, but they have contributed to the progress of education. More manpower is needed in the parastatals to assist in bringing development to the state.</li>
                    <li>Insecurity, violence, and worker strikes are major challenges to the administration because they can hinder development and progress in public services. Politics is a factor affecting leadership style and development in the state.</li>
                    <li>Respondents were of the opinion that quality leadership has enhanced economic development positively.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Quality leadership has been recognized as an indispensable tool for development in Nigeria. Democratic governance in Plateau State has been a strong and reliable means for service delivery. Quality leadership and service delivery are essential components of the overall process of Nigeria's economic development. The policies of the government make leadership and service delivery critical components for development.</p>
                <p>Although leadership and development in Plateau State have been significantly affected by political factors in service delivery.</p>
