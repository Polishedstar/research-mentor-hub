            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>An examination of certain indicators of performance indicates that the domestic and international poverty reduction measures have had minimal impact in addressing the problems of rural development and also had insignificant impact on the living conditions of the rural dwellers in Nigeria. The general consideration of these measures indicates that the government policies and strategies that where established to eradicate poverty and improve the standard of living of rural community dwellers were badly implemented and even had no particular focus on the development of rural community citizens in terms of design and implementation.</p>
            
                <p>The strategies try as much as possible to create the opportunity to empower the rural citizens, but they are found wanting in the areas of community development because the rural people are not part in the execution and implementation of rural development programmes and policies. This points to the fact that efficient design of poverty reduction programmes in Nigeria requires that the rural community people must be identified and targeted, and policies adopted should be consistent and sustainable for them. This calls for an articulated policy document for poverty alleviation in Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>This study contributes immensely to the body of knowledge and existing literature on evaluating the challenges militating against rural development in Nigeria in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conceptualizing:</strong> It has shed more light on definitions of rural development and the impact of rural development strategies, policies, and programs in the improvement of the standard of living of rural citizens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Theoretically:</strong> It shows how the Elite theory applies to the initiation, execution, and implementation of government programs and policies in developing the rural communities and also improving the standard of living of the rural citizens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Empirically:</strong> The findings of this study are also in accordance with other existing findings on the challenges militating against rural development in Nigeria.</li>
                </ul>
