            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study indicates that promotional strategies have played a very significant role in the company's product, especially the three tools of promotion: advertising, sales promotion, and publicity. They have been effective in creating awareness of the company's product and improving the company's image to outsiders.</p>
                <p>The methodology used for generating relevant data for this research work was primarily through questionnaires and personal interviews, as discussed in Chapter Three. It was discovered that advertising, sales promotion, and publicity were the major tools employed by the company to achieve their sales objectives. Sales promotion is primarily used by Nasco Foods Company to outperform their competition. In Chapter Four, which includes data analysis and interpretation through statistical testing, it showed that advertising and sales promotion have significantly impacted Nasco Foods Nigeria Limited, Jos.</p>
                <p>From the study, it has been established that the promotional mix is an effective tool for marketing strategies, as analysis has shown its effectiveness. The management of Nasco Foods Nigeria Limited should strictly adhere to their promotional policies as they aim to reach new consumers and sustain their existing market.</p>
                <p>This study's findings can also be generalized to other organizations facing similar environmental factors or conditions. In conclusion, there is no doubt that promotional strategies have a significant impact on consumer patronage.</p>
