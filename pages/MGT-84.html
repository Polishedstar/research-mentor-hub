            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The researcher set out with the primary aim of finding out the role of small-scale businesses in employment generation in Jos South Local Government Area. It was discovered that small-scale businesses have a direct bearing on employment due to the important role they play in the utilization of both human and material resources, providing employment opportunities, and improving the quality of life in the entire rural area. Small-scale businesses are also faced with various problems that affect their ability to achieve their objectives, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electricity</li>
                    <li>Good drinking water</li>
                    <li>Communication network</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Government has also contributed to addressing these issues by implementing programs such as the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), Agricultural Development Project (ADPS), Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NER FUND), and Better Life Programmes (BLP), among others. These programs have been put in place at various times to support small-scale businesses and combat unemployment. However, more needs to be done to ensure the effective implementation of these programs.</p>
                <p>Most of the responses obtained from those operating small-scale businesses indicate that they are the lifeblood of the local population in the Local Government Area. In conclusion, the growth of small businesses in Jos South Local Government Area will depend on the following factors:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The development of infrastructure (e.g., good network, accessible roads, availability of markets, and stores).</li>
                    <li>Investment opportunities, which may not naturally occur due to the factors mentioned in (i) above.</li>
                    <li>Granting of loans.</li>
                    <li>Mass orientation and mobilization. The Local Government can organize workshops for small-scale business operators to facilitate the adoption of modern business techniques.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It has become increasingly apparent to government and policymakers that the role of small-scale and medium-scale enterprises is essential for the development and growth of any given economy. Small and medium-scale enterprises ensure efficient resource utilization, create employment opportunities, mobilize domestic savings, and promote investment.</p>
