            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Based on the result from chapter four of the study, we could come out with the following views about the impact of communication on organizational performance:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The performance of workers is dependent on effective communication. With a free and efficient flow of information and a well-established communication system, workers perform more accurately than when there is a communication barrier.</li>
                    <li>The organization's environment affects communication. A well-structured organization with hierarchical communication channels may appear tedious but maintains a high degree of professionalism. In contrast, less organized organizations may have faster information flow but lack formality.</li>
                    <li>Communication affects the peace in an organization. Effective communication allows individuals to share information, views, and feelings, promoting peace and stability.</li>
                    <li>There are lapses in communication management in both private and public organizations. Barriers to information flow can be found in some organizations.</li>
                    <li>Communication is a vital instrument in promoting effective and efficient worker performance in an organization.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This research work has explored the communication system and its impact on organizational performance, emphasizing the importance of communication in the job/work performance of workers in an organization. Although the study is not comprehensive in itself, it serves as a foundation for further research in related areas of study.</p>
