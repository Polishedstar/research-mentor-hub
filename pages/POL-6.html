            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study focused on Privatization and Service Delivery in Jos Electricity Distribution Company. The objectives of the study were to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine the performance of Jos Electricity Distribution, Plc so far.</li>
                    <li>Determine the challenges of Jos Electricity Distribution, Plc.</li>
                    <li>Examine the impact of privatization on service delivery.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Below are the summary of findings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Privatization reduces corruption and parasitic mentality, infusing capital and modernized technology into our industries, many of which have not seen any improvements for years. Privatization promotes competence, transparency, and better management.</li>
                    <li>JED Plc has not provided meters to every household in Plateau state, the power supply in the state is usually interrupted, and there is poor maintenance of power cables and transformers by JED Plc.</li>
                    <li>JED Plc faces a high level of financial mismanagement; it experiences both corruption and nepotism and also experiences a problem of finance shortage.</li>
                    <li>The services of JED Plc have gotten better since its privatization, it has become more efficient and has employed managers with the best skills.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The importance of the implementation of the privatization program to service delivery in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized. The private sector is poised and equipped to deliver services effectively and efficiently if given the leeway to do so. It behooves the Federal Government of Nigeria to provide favorable conditions that would enable these private sector operators to thrive and carry out their functions as expected. By reducing the cost of production, availability of electric power, accessibility of credit facilities and funding, reduction of political interference and politicizing the processes, removal of multiple taxation outlets, maintaining policy agreements, eliminating policy somersaults, curtailing intimidation of private sector workers in privatized enterprises by government officials, providing public enlightenment for citizens and beneficiaries of services, an efficient feedback mechanism to measure the performance of privatized enterprises cum service delivery, and a proper balance between a maximized profit motive and a service delivery orientation of the privatized enterprise will go a long way in bringing to reality the benefits of efficient provision of services that the privatization program has to offer.</p>
                <p>This study is conducted in order to examine the impact of privatization on service delivery in JED Plc. Based on the analysis of this study, it has been concluded that privatization has a significant impact on service delivery in JED Plc.</p>
