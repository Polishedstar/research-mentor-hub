            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This section summarizes the study, which results on the impact of UA on households’ income, access to foodstuffs in Bassa LGA, and the extent to which it is acting as a livelihood strategy to households that are prone to food insecurity.</p>
            
                <p>Urban agriculture participants in Bassa LGA had the largest proportions of the old-aged, female-headed, singles or divorced, widowed, lowly educated, and informally employed households with higher dependency ratios and household sizes compared to non-participants.</p>
            
                <p>The study revealed that UA contributes up to 74 percent of households’ income in Bassa. This amounts to US$820.35 annually, which is statistically greater than 50%. Income saved by the participants, on average from weekly consumption from subsistence in-season, was amounting to US$12.70.</p>
            
                <p>Bassa LGA residents’ maize harvest lasted 4.14 months on average. Consumption of sweet potatoes, peas, pumpkin fruits, pumpkin leaves, and beans was statistically higher than that of the non-participants in-season. In the off-season, only consumption of vegetables was significantly higher than that of non-participants.</p>
