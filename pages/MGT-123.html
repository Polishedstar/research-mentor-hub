            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the presentation and analysis of data, several findings were made. The summaries of findings are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The achievement of organizational goals can only be possible if there is effective leadership in the organization. The effectiveness depends on good planning and direction for resources both human and material for attainment of an organizational set goals and objectives.</li>
                    <li>The study also discovered that conflict is inevitable in any organization where there is human interaction, so management should strive to address it as soon as it occurs.</li>
                    <li>Conflict may affect organizational productivity positively or negatively that, the management of conflict cannot be ignored conflict can only be managed through effective dialogue, conciliation, mediation, and arbitration in an organization.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is evident that conflict situations do occur in all organizations between subordinates and supervisors or immediate supervisors and even among workers on the same grade. Effective leadership is needed to provide a conducive working environment to enable workers to exercise the utmost efficiency at work. As stated in the summary of the findings, conflict is inevitable in human interaction, and organizations need to improve their leadership ability to manage conflict to reduce the frequency and negative aspects of conflict in public organizations in Nigeria.</p>
