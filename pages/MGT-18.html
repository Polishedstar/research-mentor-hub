            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In undertaking this research, it was discovered from responses resulting from the questionnaires administered that: Motivation is necessary to boost employee productivity in any given organization. A clearly spelt out motivation goes a long way in determining productivity. Employees, no matter their cadre, require proper motivation or rather need to be motivated for them to ensure maximum attainment of goals and objectives of an organization.</p>
                <p>The problems observed to be present in organizations are brought into focus, some of which include poor remuneration, absence of research facilities, the application of wrong motivation tools, and participation of workers in decision making of employees.</p>
                <p>Further effort was intensified towards identifying the different sources of motivation and their application. The objectives of the study included the creation of awareness as to what constitutes motivation, highlighted techniques through which employees could be encouraged to pursue their careers more diligently, efficiently, and loyally to curtail the case of exploitation of human efforts. In addition, employees placed a premium on 'spirit de corps' or firm culture and congenitally and recognition, money was lower on the scale.</p>
                <p>Management of the organization, on the other hand, placed a greater emphasis on monetary factors with training and recognition following well behind. This study, though constrained by well sample size, shows a marked difference between employees and management as to what constitutes successful motivation. Both groups agree that motivation is significant in influencing performance.</p>
                <p>Finally, the findings of this research work led the researcher to infer that if staff are not motivated, productivity falls down below standard, thus leading to non-realization of organizational growth.</p>
