            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>It was clearly stated in the previous chapters that the objective of this assignment is to find out the impact of adult education towards community development of Heipang village in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area. It has been vividly shown that adult education contributes greatly towards the eradication of illiteracy in Heipang community of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area.</p>
                <p>The above statement became a reality because on the tables of respondents, it has been clearly shown that adult education contributes greatly towards community development. It was found in table I that 83% out of 100% agreed that adult education can reduce the problem of poverty. In table II, 55 respondents clearly indicated that adult education can help eradicate illiteracy, with 91.7% of the total respondents stating that. In table III, 78% agreed that adult education reduces ignorance and strengthens democracy in Heipang. In table IV, about 86.7% agreed that adult education reduces ignorance and strengthens democracy in Heipang. In table V, 90% agreed that adult education promotes development. All other responses are positive, indicating that adult education is mostly needed for community development.</p>
                <p>From the research conducted, it is evidently proved to the researcher that adult education has a significant impact in educating the rural populace toward sustainable development. This is because the research showed that adult education eradicates illiteracy and poverty, and will further sustain democracy and peace, which will enhance effective manpower services through vocational and professional training for adults.</p>
