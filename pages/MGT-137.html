            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research findings consist of the staff of Nigerian Bottling Company with some selected consumers as the study population with the use of simple random sampling. It was discovered that the organization embarks on promotion using the promotional tools such as advertisement, sales promotion, personal selling and that the promotional tools enhance sales and make the company survive competitively.</p>
                <p>Moreover, that promotion stimulates consumers into buying NBC’s brand of soft drinks and helps in determining consumer buying behavior. However, lack of proper promotion, poor management, and external factors lead to low patronage of NBC’s brand of soft drinks.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, on the part of the consumers, it was discovered that social habit and reducing weight are the reasons why they drink. Some drink soft drinks regularly while some do not drink regularly, and NBC’s brand of soft drinks promotion contributes highly to their buying decision.</p>
                <p>The competitiveness of a firm is determined by its ability to make a profit, increase sales, increase market share, etc. That shows that NBC company is able to do these as reflected by the acceptance of the questions by the responses.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, promotion has a positive impact on consumer buying behavior, and promotion is a competitive tool in the marketing of NBC’s brand of soft drinks.</p>
                <p>The prospects of promotion are the following: increase sales, improve the company’s survival competitively, stimulate consumers’ behavior into buying, and create a good image of the company.</p>
