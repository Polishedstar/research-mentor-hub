            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Political crisis accounts for over 60% of the problems associated with the sustenance of democracy in Nigeria. This includes issues like the breakdown of law and order, destruction of lives and properties, stimulation of military intervention, and mutual distrust among political parties.</li>
                    <li>Political parties contribute positively to over 50% of the sustenance of democracy in Nigeria at the local and federal government levels. This contribution is in terms of political education, accountability, socialization, population, and based on the principles of the rule of law.</li>
                    <li>Free and fair elections are instrumental in 80% of the effective stability of every democracy. They promote freedom of the press, independence of the judiciary, and an independent National Electoral body or commission in the country.</li>
                    <li>Political leaders do not use public resources to settle their members. This includes issues related to family background, greed, and misuse of funds.</li>
                    <li>The major problems of democratic government in Nigeria include lack of effective networking, lack of training for members, poor funding, party conflicts, corruption, political interference, and poor autonomy of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), resulting in problems related to unfair and unfree elections.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The study underscores the crucial role of political parties in the sustenance of democracy in Nigeria. Political parties are instrumental in installing a robust and sustainable democratic system in the country. They have played a significant role in selecting office holders, advocating certain policies for development, and promoting development programs to improve the lives of citizens.</p>
                <p>The conclusion is that democratic governance in Nigeria relies on the efficiency of political parties in conducting free and fair elections and fostering a spirit of sportsmanship after elections.</p>
