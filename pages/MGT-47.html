            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This chapter in this research work contains the findings made by the researcher, the conclusion made on the subject matter, and the recommendations made.</p>
                <p>As it has been shown in chapter one, the introductory part of the research work, literature has been reviewed, and a conceptual framework has been done in chapter two.</p>
                <p>Similarly, chapter three gives details on the research method and procedure used for data collection or gathering. Data presentation and analysis were done in chapter four.</p>
                <p>The findings are summarized; conclusions and recommendations were stated in chapter five of this work.</p>
                <p>In this research work, the following conclusions were made:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The assumptions of people that most Nigerians always associated high price to high quality were proven to be true.</li>
                    <li>There is always a negative reaction from people whenever there is a price reduction on Grand Cereal products.</li>
                    <li>There is always a positive reaction from consumers whenever there is a price reduction on Grand Cereals products.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That pricing policies affect consumers' goods in addition to the above conclusions. Most manufacturing companies that produce similar products to that of Grand Cereals should observe the above findings and the suggested recommendations based on the research problem.</p>
