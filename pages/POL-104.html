            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The undertaking of this research study has witnessed considerable pronouncements, data collection operations, and subsequent analysis. All these have been towards providing a basic ground for the verification of the validity, practicability, and viability of the topic of this research study.</p>
                <p>In chapter one of the research, the researcher through descriptive theoretical modes itemized the major motivating factors behind this study, taking a detailed view of the privatization program of the federal government which was officially flagged off in 1998 to date, with the sole focus of outlining the purposeful effects of the operation of NITEL corporation. The area of scope and significance of this study centered around NITEL offices and environs of Abuja and Jos, Plateau state was also itemized.</p>
                <p>In chapter two, the establishment work of literary dimension related to this study was adequately detailed out, pointing out the conceptual framework of privatization and further highlighting the observed problems and challenges expected to be in the implementation of the program in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>A vivid coverage of the method used in the collection of raw data and information was described in chapter three. For this study, the primary method of questionnaire and interview was utilized on a sample of 120 staff and non-staff expert members in the line of telecommunication service.</p>
                <p>In chapter four, the collected data and secondary information were analyzed, employed in testing the validity of our hypothesis as stated in chapter one. Findings from our representation and analysis show that the alternative hypothesis purporting the viability and strength of the privatization program on NITEL and the Nigerian economy is a tentative fact and thus valid.</p>
