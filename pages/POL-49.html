            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>All along this project has dealt mainly with training as a tool for improving productivity in the civil service, emphasizing the importance of training and retraining programs. Given the demanding nature of society's expectations from the public service, especially the civil service, the development of a service-oriented organization is essential to meet those expectations.</p>
            
                <p>This study has highlighted the inadequacy of training, particularly the shortage of skilled manpower, a point emphasized by many scholars. The shortage of experienced, skilled manpower is a critical problem in the public service, and it affects all categories and levels of the service.</p>
            
                <p>The role of the civil service as a government organ has also been emphasized. It is crucial for the civil service to initiate and actively participate in the policy formulation and execution processes. Training is essential to make the civil service more responsive and alert to government's development programs and to address concerns about lethargy.</p>
            
                <p>With the unified grading system introduced in 1975, professionals in the service can be laterally transferred to administration. However, there has been an uneasy relationship between career administrators and laterally transferred officers to the administrative cadre. A well-planned training program for transferee administrators could help remove the air of 'superiority' implied occasionally in the actions of career administrators.</p>
                <p>There is a need to reorient the civil service through training to meet the new challenges of political, social, and economic development in the nation. A coherent training policy should be established to address societal needs, with a focus on the development of the state.</p>
            
                <p>Training serves as a motivating factor in any organization, benefiting both employers and employees. It improves work performance, keeps trainees up to date in their specialist fields, and ensures the quality of work required by the establishment is achieved and maintained. The purpose of training in the public service is to enhance government effectiveness by increasing the capacity and efficiency of officers. It also fosters team spirit, a prerequisite for the successful implementation of government programs.</p>
            
                <p>Plateau State Government needs to develop a systematic training program for civil servants with the objectives of increasing competence and effectiveness, preparing officers for higher responsibilities, and producing a corps of highly specialized officers for the state civil service. Government activities are expanding and becoming more complex, requiring expert personnel to manage them</p>
