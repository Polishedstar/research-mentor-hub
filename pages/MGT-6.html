            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of this research, it has been discovered that Small Scale Business mitigates the rate of unemployment which bedevils the economic position of developing countries. Among its numerous contributions include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Its impact on Gross Domestic Product of the Nigerian Economy (Plateau State in particular).</li>
                    <li>Employment opportunities which foster improvement in the standard of living.</li>
                    <li>Sources of government revenue and a host of other effects.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These achievements are stressed objectives of every developing nation. Credit must be given to this category of business and, as such, they need to be provided with sufficient assistance to the growth of such businesses, as observed in the outcry for financial, managerial, and other related support.</p>
                <p>The constant flow of substandard products in our local markets has been corrected by the overriding plan for efficiency in this kind of business. This is as a result of the remarkable fact that Small Scale Businesses encourage the availability of standard goods and services.</p>
                <p>Small-scale business, if given the enabling environment, could salvage the country from the typical third-world poverty to More Developed Countries (MDCs).</p>
                <p>The general economic state of Nigeria does not warrant any glory due to the overgrowing unemployment rate and corruption. It is evidenced that most citizens have no confidence in locally manufactured goods and services and, as such, depend largely on importation. All these shortfalls of Small Scale Business have been seen to be exterminable only if provided with sufficient relevant support. The problem with the Nigerian Economic Sector is not mainly resources but rather, mismanagement of the resources.</p>
                <p>The development of Small Scale Business will only keep at a maximum if and only if sufficient and specialized institutions charged with the responsibility of planning, control, and mobilization are ensured.</p>
