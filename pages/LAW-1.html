            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Controversies surrounding elections have serious potential to undermine the legitimacy and stability of democracy. There could be the most serious consequences for democratic development if political leaders are unable to reach consensus on rules of political conduct, and if the Nigerian public therefore becomes alienated from the electoral process. Nigerians would universally suffer from further political crises or an interruption of democratic rule. Even President Umar Musa Yar’Adua acknowledged the fact that the Nigerian electoral system needs reform. It was on the basis of the above that Yar’Adua made the issue of electoral reforms an integral part of his seven-point agenda.</p>
            
                <p>The Nigerian Electoral Law has witnessed its highs and lows. The instability in the electoral system can be blamed on the youthfulness of the process of democracy in the country, which has witnessed several interruptions by the military at different times. Coupled with this is also the issue of 'do or die politics' that has eaten deep into Nigerian politics and frustrated the electoral process and the rules guiding it. Nevertheless, the development in this area of law cannot be overemphasized; however, there is still room for improvement and reforms.</p>
            
                <p>The nature, scope, and methodology of such reforms have remained topical in national debate. This chapter is therefore aimed at recommending solutions to some problems that have been identified in the preceding chapters.</p>
            
                <p>Electoral reform is an urgent challenge for Nigeria's developing democracy. Controversies over past elections in Nigeria have undermined previous democratic regimes. It may be recalled that the controversies that erupted in the 1983 Presidential elections paved the way for the military to seize power and put an end to the fledgling democracy. Furthermore, the 1992 elections conducted by the Babaginda regime led to the June 12 crisis that almost tore the entire country apart. From historical records, it can be deduced that the electoral system in Nigeria has a lot of lapses, which makes it possible for political leaders to rig elections. This proposition was confirmed by the Court of Appeal sitting in a recent election petition matter, which described the Nigerian Electoral Act 2006 as an "Election rigging manual."</p>
            
                <p>One of the challenges that the Nigerian electoral body faces is the fact that all elections are held within the same period. This alone creates room for rigging because the electoral body is overworked and exposed to poor security arrangements. The electoral body is also faced with the challenges of poor staffing as it has to source ad hoc staff. As the nation continues to grapple with the problems associated with Nigeria's electoral system, it is essential, at this juncture, to address the problems in the electoral system and prepare the groundwork for smooth, peaceful, and credible elections in the future. There is widespread concern that irregularities in elections could undermine the legitimacy and stability of Nigeria's democratic system. Urgent reforms are therefore needed to correct these flaws in future polls.</p>
