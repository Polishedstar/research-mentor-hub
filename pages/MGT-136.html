            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>An entrepreneur is an individual who has the ability to see and evaluate business opportunities, gather the necessary resources to make advantage of them and initiate appropriate action to ensure success.</p>
                <p>Aside from the motive of success alongside the profit maximization syndrome, they ought to be knowledgeable about the contributory aspect of entrepreneurship roles in nation’s building, which will serve as a guide to anyone who wants to venture any kind of business, having in mind the basic role it plays in the growth and development of the country.</p>
                <p>The above assertion emphasizes the general notion of entrepreneurship roles in nation's building to a large extent, which helps checkmate the unemployment problems faced by the citizens of this country.</p>
                <p>Also, every business owner with the profit syndrome mentality and negligent of the role of his/her enterprise towards the growth and development of the country will result in product offerings to society without impact felt by the citizens of the particular society.</p>
                <p>In the results, the business owners are cognizant of the fact that their product delivery will determine the extent to which its effect can be felt and, as such, determine the role it plays in nation-building.</p>
                <p>Hence, entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the growth and development of the country.</p>
                <p>The researcher, from his findings, made us understand that most business enterprises venture into the field of entrepreneurship knowing fully well about the roles played by it in nation’s building (growth and development), and also, the society is cognizant of the role played by entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>It is an established fact that entrepreneurship roles are amongst the major determining factors of the nation’s economic growth and development, such that any business enterprise cannot detach itself from the role played by its enterprises to the citizens.</p>
                <p>However, the attitude of the public towards any business enterprise can pose effects either positively or negatively. Many small-scale business enterprises are already cognizant of their role towards the growth and development of the country despite the challenges posed by the populace.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, most business enterprises have realized that existence and success in business cannot be made possible without impacting the populace of the society or the nation at large.</p>
