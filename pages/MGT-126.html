            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The contributions which product packaging has made to marketing industries and its impacts on consumers' purchasing decisions have developed the country's economy. Product packaging by industries in Nigeria is a good ground for development in the society as a choice.</p>
                <p>The research discovered that product packaging is a vital tool used to boost sales.</p>
                <p>It was confirmed that there is a high demand for goods and services by consumers despite the high price of goods for any company that has a good strategic packaging style.</p>
                <p>It also observed that companies tend to have low returns where there is a low or poor packaging system because there will be low or poor patronage.</p>
                <p>Product packaging plays a very vital role in consumers' purchase decisions because it attracts the customer's attention by good color design.</p>
                <p>In the course of this research work, the summaries of findings are based on the data presentation and analysis of data, which are presented in the form of frequency tables from the previous chapter, and these include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It reveals that the role of packaging plays in the consumer decision-making process cannot be overemphasized, as they judge the product from its packaging.</li>
                    <li>It was confirmed that packaging plays a vital role in stimulating, retaining, as well as winning the interest of a new product and consumers to purchase a company's product. Companies that have been using this have witnessed tremendous increases in sales.</li>
                    <li>The findings show that it is imperative for companies to design and package their products well. That is, their package should carry the company's name, logo, trademark, and so on.</li>
                    <li>It also indicates that failure to pay attention to packaging by companies will lead to poor and unpleasant consequences such as an inability to achieve company goals, loss of goodwill, excess stock levels, low sales, and hence low profitability.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Results of the research study regarding the impact of packaging on consumer purchasing decisions stipulated the following conclusions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Packaging could be treated as one of the most valuable tools in today's marketing communications, necessitating more detailed analysis of its elements and the impact of those elements on consumer purchasing decisions.</li>
                    <li>Appropriate and vivid pictures or colors, which deliver a happy feeling, or an easy-to-handle, open packaging shape. All these elements contribute each important effort to catch consumers' attention and interest.</li>
                    <li>Packaging has a better reach than advertising does and can set a brand apart from its competitors. It promotes and reinforces the purchasing decision not only at the point of purchase but also every time the product is used.</li>
                    <li>Packaging in different sizes can extend a product into new target markets or help to overcome cost barriers.</li>
                    <li>Most companies use packaging to facilitate sales and to succeed in the highly competitive business world. However, some companies do not take packaging seriously, even though they know its importance.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In other words, one can say that Nasco Pack Limited and their products have, to a reasonable extent, met the packaging needs of customers, which result in their consumers having a favorable buying decision. There is no doubt that packaging, as one of the tools used in marketing to stimulate consumer acceptance of a product, has contributed immensely to the buying decision of consumers of Nasco products, especially products like biscuits, soap, detergent, and so on, which have many competitors and have led to an oversaturation of the market with different types of similar products. In this case, Nasco Pack has continued to maintain high quality in the packaging of its products.</p>
