            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study investigated the relationship between social media usage and the academic performance of students at the University of Lagos. The research employed a descriptive survey research design. A sample of 378 respondents was selected from a population of 24,661 full-time undergraduate students at the university using a confidence interval of 5 and a confidence level of 95% (0.05). The sample was chosen using a simple random sampling technique, with seventy-five students randomly selected from five randomly chosen faculties at the University of Lagos.</p>
                <p>A self-developed Likert-type scale questionnaire, titled "Social Media and Academic Performance of Students Questionnaire (SMAAPOS)," was used for data collection. The questionnaire was thoroughly scrutinized by the project supervisor, validated, and found to be reliable. The data were collected through personal administration by the researcher.</p>
                <p>The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including frequency count and percentage. Hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics, specifically the Chi-square (χ²) test, at a 0.05 level of significance.</p>
                <p>The results of the study indicated that students' addiction to social networks significantly influences their academic performance. Additionally, students' exposure to social media networks has a significant influence on their academic performance. The use of social media also has a significant influence on students' academic performance. The study also found a significant influence of students' social media network usage by age.</p>
