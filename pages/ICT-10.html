            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research aimed at finding out the factors that influence the implementation of ICT projects in public secondary schools in Kwale County. From an analysis and review of the research data and additional data gathered through the respondents and informants, a number of issues became apparent.</p>
                <p>The first objective of the study was to establish how infrastructural facilities influence the implementation of Information Communication Technology projects in public secondary schools in Kwale County, Nigeria. Data analysis, interpretation of interview responses and questionnaire responses from the respondents of the study revealed that infrastructure plays a major role in implementing ICT projects in schools. In the study, for example, a greater percentage of above 60% of the schools were lacking formal and well-equipped computer laboratories. Others had turned their classrooms into makeshift computer laboratories. Only 3.85% of the schools had more than 20 computers. With the increasing number of students in schools, a number less than 20 computers is much lower than the standard agreed ICT4ED 2010 agreement. Only 20% of the population indicated that in their schools there was fully power supply from electricity and back-up generator while 10% of the schools still have no source of power. Frequent power blackouts rated high as part of the challenges that were facing most schools in ICT projects implementation. Therefore, infrastructural development has to be taken into account when implementing ICT projects in schools because they are closely tied.</p>
                <p>On the objective that sought to establish how school administrative practices influence the implementation of Information Communication Technology projects in public secondary schools in Kwale County, Nigeria. The respondents had the view that most administrators in secondary schools in Kwale County donâ€™t support the implementation of ICT projects fully. This was with 65% of the respondents, while 5% were not sure and 30% agreed that school administration supports ICT. The administrative practices included financing of computer programs in school and facilitating in-service training of the teachers as well as employing teachers to teach computer skills. Most schools lacked ICT policies that would enable proper integration of ICTs in teaching and learning. High cost of ICT maintenance pushes the principals to cut down on the use of ICTs in teaching and learning. Some other Principals were found to be dictators who rarely accommodated the ideas of the benefits of ICT in school learning and teaching while others had great fear and a bad notion that computers in schools were unnecessary expenditure and they could spoil the students once they accessed materials from the outside world.</p>
                <p>The third objective was to determine how financial resources influence the implementation of Information Communication Technology projects in public secondary schools in Kwale County, Nigeria. The study found out that most schools did not have enough financial resources set aside to boost and implement ICT projects. This was shown when 41.7% of the respondents strongly disagreed with the view that there are adequate financial resources for ICT projects in their schools while 45.8% of the respondents disagreed with the statement that their schools spend a reasonable amount of money on ICT implementation. This was also with the principals during the interview when 6 of the 8 strongly argued that implementing ICT projects in their schools was a challenge since most of them had constrained budgets. This has left many ICT projects in the public schools in Kwale County at a hanging level since most of them have no finances that could see their effective implementation.</p>
                <p>On the final objective that sought to examine the influence of stakeholders in Information Communication Technology projects' implementation in public secondary schools in Kwale County, Nigeria, it was found that the major funding for ICT projects in schools came from the government. This was supported by 34.61% of the respondents, while 30.77% of the respondents went for the NGOs. This meant that the government and the NGOs are doing a lot to ensure ICT projects are a success, though little has been done from the BOG, capable teachers, and other relevant stakeholders like politicians. Besides stakeholders like the BOG, Government, and Donors not fully participating in implementing ICT projects by providing computers, finances, and building computer laboratories just like it is done in other places, accessibility of the computers by students and teachers in most schools was limited to once a week or twice a month, and this has been a factor that has led to poor ICT implementation in schools. These factors have dragged ICT projects' implementation in public secondary schools in the country.</p>
