            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In summarizing the findings of this research work, the researcher makes the following summary:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The researchers discovered that industrial unrest is the only tool used by workers to channel their demands to the management of the organization.</li>
                    <li>The researcher also discovered that non-payment of workers' entitlement brings about industrial unrest.</li>
                    <li>However, industrial action brings about organizational productivity when legally and properly embarked upon, and collective bargaining is a possible alternative or solution to industrial unrest in organizations.</li>
                    <li>Finally, conflict resolution is another major tool that will harmonize management and employees' representatives by ending the conflict so as to improve workers' performance and organizational productivity.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the study, it can be concluded that effective or productive organization requires the effective satisfaction of workers' needs and also the needs of the organization. If workers are constantly motivated and satisfied, their attitude towards work will be in a position to achieve the aims and objectives of the organization, which will also improve organizational productivity.</p>
