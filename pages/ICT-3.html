            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The aim of the study was to assess the usage and performance of ICT on SMEs in Gbolo-Kpalsi, Sagnarigu District. In review, the study sought to assess the usage, performance of ICT, and to determine the challenges associated with the adaptation of ICT in the Sagnarigu District, Tamale. The questionnaire was designed in line with the objectives of the study. The task involved; analyzing the effects of ICT usage on the performance of SMEs, identifying the possible factors hindering the adaptation of ICT in SMEs, and recommendations to those factors.</p>
            
                <p>In this chapter, the researchers reviewed previous studies with an intention of establishing academic gaps within the Sagnarigu District of which the present study sought to bridge. This was done through the internet and field research. The procedure included: reading, evaluating the methodology employed in terms of design choice, target population, sample and sampling data collection instruments (that is appropriate, valid, and reliable), data collection procedures, data analysis, findings, and recommendations. This study benefited much from the literature review which guided the present study by pointing to areas that needed to be investigated.</p>
            
                <p>The study engaged in descriptive survey research as the main approach to guide the study. The target population under the study was both the registered and unregistered SMEs in Gbolo-Kpalsi, totaling about 530 SMEs. The research instrument used for the data collection was questionnaires. The data was collected and summarized into tables and figures. The study revealed that 57 respondents representing 63.3% of the businesses used ICT, while 33 respondents representing 36.7% of the businesses have not adopted ICT in their firms. 54 of the businesses which were using ICT representing a larger value of 94.7% used the computer in their regular business activities, while 3 respondents representing 3.3% were not using the computer. The study further reveals that the software resources used largely in the businesses were office software represented by 87.7% of 57 businesses and 7 firms representing 12.3% used sales management and media, hence the least IT resource used by firms. The data further shows that firms use ICT to improve business activity; the study shows that indeed ICT has led to better and quality services since it improves the service of delivery, saves time used in production, and increased output to meet the demand of customers, as customers nowadays pay attention to quality, and this tends to increase the revenue of firms that adopt ICT in their businesses.</p>
            
                <p>The study also indicates that few of the SMEs are ICT inclined, and SMEs in such industry are expected to always be up with the technologies needed to meet demands of customers since ICT is dynamic.</p>
            
                <p>The study also shows that 63 of the respondents agreed the use of ICT has improved the performance of businesses due to faster service delivery, improved communication, improved quality of products and services, better customer satisfaction, reduced transportation, security, and communication costs, which resulted in increased revenue.</p>
            
                <p>The findings revealed that the majority of the respondents had mobile phones and computers to perform their business activities, the evident that mobile phones and communication networks have improved the performance of SMEs by reducing communication costs.</p>
            
                <p>Furthermore, considering firms' usage of the internet, although most of the SMEs find the internet to be important, they do not use it to advertise products and services because of certain constraints and challenges like lack of knowledge about its usage, unreliable service providers, limited knowledge of what ICT can do, limited ICT skills, the cost involved in adopting ICT, security concerns, no interest adopting ICT, and personal reasons, which we believe that with time and the address of these constraints, firms will take advantage of the benefits associated with ICT since the results show high usage of the facility. The results show that most of the firms fail to use ICT for the benefit of their business as well as create a comparative advantage due to a lack of knowledge as to how to use it and what ICT can do.</p>
            
                <p>Moreover, the majority of the firms that use the internet mainly use it on social platforms and general business information rather than advertising business products and services. Firms who use the internet are those who are young in the industry and are willing to explore and accept change rather than those grown in the business that are reluctant to change and prefer their old ways of doing business.</p>
            
                <p>Although profit is likely to drop slightly due to the cost associated with ICT adaptation, it does not dispute the fact that ICT increases productivity.</p>
