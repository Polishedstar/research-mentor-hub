            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Management of organizational resources seems to be a common phenomenon. Organizations like Nigerian Export Promotion Council today come with necessary facilities, but often, one discovers that those businesses that seem to start on a very strong footing are no longer directing organizational resources toward the attainment of set goals, which is of paramount and great importance.</p>
                
                <p>The summary made from the study is as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Human capital development contributes towards organizational performance and productivity in terms of the optimum use of human resources, capital, machinery currently employed, and provision for the future manpower needs, in terms of skill number ages.</li>
                    <li>Human capital development enhances the optimum use of the workforce in terms of efficient staff productivity in the organization.</li>
                    <li>The efficient use of manpower and machinery can be achieved through human capital development in an organization in terms of getting the right and efficient workforce into position in the organization to achieve specific goals.</li>
                    <li>Management training and development enhance efficient human capital development in terms of promoting skills and knowledge in planning, organizing, directing, and coordinating resources to achieve goals.</li>
                    <li>Management training and development enhance efficient human capital development in terms of promoting skills and knowledge in planning, organizing, directing, and coordinating resources to achieve goals.</li>
