            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>To increase the capabilities, motivation, and overall effectiveness of the FTCs, proper planning and management of human resources within extension organizations is essential. Furthermore, to be more relevant to the needs of farmers, extension policy should be reviewed and formulated through a participation approach. This process could be initiated by dedicated professionals from the public and private sectors, with the active participation of farmers themselves. All these will be effective if the major limiting factors are clearly identified and alleviated.</p>
            
                <p>The objectives of the study were to investigate the extent to which farmers contribute to the development of the training programs; to examine in which stage do farmers’ participate in skill training programs; and to investigate the major factors influencing farmers’ participation in skill training program. To achieve this, the survey research design was used. The data were collected through the questionnaire, semi-structured interview and FGDs. The participants were 128 trainee farmers, 21 facilitators, and six key informants. To select the respondent groups, simple random, availability, and purposive sampling techniques were used respectively. Frequencies, percentages, and means, correlation, factor analysis, multiple regressions, and Mann-Whitney U-test were used as statistical tools to analyze the data.</p>
            
                <p>Based on these objectives, the major findings of the study are summarized as follows:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>The data used for the study were found to be high in its reliability. The items in each variable have high communalities in describing the variables and loaded at a significant level. This tells us the analysis and findings made on this study were based on reliable and objective data.</li>
                    <li>Concerning the farmers’ contribution to the development of the training program, the majority of the trainees (105 or 82%) had no contribution in the planning process of the training program.</li>
                    <li>Farmers’ level of participation at different stages of the training program was found to be almost none except at the implementation stage in which relatively high participation was observed.</li>
                    <li>With regard to limiting factors, the descriptive results revealed that almost all institutional, socio-cultural, and structural factors had negative impacts on farmers’ participation in the training program given at the FTCs. However, the majority of both respondent groups (82.0% of trainees and 76.2% of facilitators) were positive towards the trainees’ selection criteria.</li>
                    <li>The trainees’ demographic profile revealed that there is disparity between trainees’ educational status that would create a difference in the level of trainees’ participation.</li>
                    <li>The findings of multiple regression analysis show that all the independent variables (institutional, socio-cultural, and structural factors) had a significant combined (interaction) effect on the prediction of farmers’ participation. The three major factors as a whole (collectively) had a significant impact on the variation of farmers’ participation at (P<0.05).</li>
                    <li>The most crucial factors of farmers’ participation in the modular training program were institutional factors. It had a significant negative influence on farmers’ participation at (P<0.05). In line with this, the results of semi-structured interviews and FGDs were consistent with this finding.</li>
                    <li>The second influential factors of farmers’ participation were the socio-cultural factors. It had a negatively significant contribution on farmers’ participation at (P<0.05).</li>
                    <li>The third determining factors of farmers’ participation were the structural factors. It had also a significantly negative impact on farmers’ participation.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the results of Mann-Whitney U-test revealed that the responses of the trainee farmers and the facilitators had no significant difference. This implies that both respondent groups were consistent in rating the limiting factors.</li>
