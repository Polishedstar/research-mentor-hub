        <div class="work--lockup--options--findings">
            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study aimed to determine how two Nigerian newspapers, The Guardian and Vanguard, covered sickle cell anemia stories throughout the year 2015. The assessment by these newspapers was approached from three key perspectives: prominence, direction, and themes/issues.</p>
            
                <p>The data analysis revealed that both newspapers provided limited coverage of sickle cell disease, with 15 stories for 334 editions in The Guardian and 12 stories for 334 editions in the Vanguard over the course of a year. This indicates a failure in their responsibility to frame selected aspects of perceived reality in a way that promotes problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation. Furthermore, it fails to contribute to the improvement of the health lifestyles of Nigerian society and the healthcare sector of the nation by disseminating health information.</p>
            
                <p>Despite being a non-communicable disease recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the newspapers did not focus on reducing, creating awareness, or educating the public about the disease. The health condition in Nigeria necessitates interventions from various social institutions, including the media. The media have the potential to improve the health lifestyles of Nigerian society and the healthcare sector by disseminating health information.</p>
            
                <p>While health communication scholars in Nigeria have conducted several studies examining the role of the media in delivering health information and creating awareness about health issues, little has been done in examining the potential effects of disseminating health information through the media on sickle cell disease to newspaper readers in Nigeria. Similarly, there has been limited exploration of newspaper coverage of health issues related to sickle cell disease, despite the prevalence of this health problem in Nigeria.</p>
            
                <p>The study introduced the research gaps and objectives in chapter one and presented relevant literature in chapter two. Framing theory was chosen as the theoretical guide for the study. Chapter two explored the historical background of newspapers in Nigeria and the role of newspapers as a medium of mass communication, a key variable in this study. It also reviewed the media's framing of health stories, health education and communication, sickle cell disease, its historical origin, and treatment.</p>
            
                <p>The research reviewed relevant literature on major health issues in Nigeria, with an emphasis on HIV/AIDS and malaria. Two research questions were formulated to determine the variables, focusing on the prominence, emphasized issues, and the direction of coverage of sickle cell issues in Nigerian newspapers. The content analysis method was employed to answer these questions.</p>
            
                <p>Chapter four discussed data analysis and interpretation from the content analysis, revealing that Nigerian newspapers disseminate stories on various health issues, including sickle cell disorder. However, it was found that these newspapers did not prominently and strategically report health problems. They mainly confined the coverage of sickle cell disease and other health issues to inside pages, which suggests that health issues were not given prominent coverage in Nigerian newspapers.</p>
            
                <p>The study concluded that Nigerian newspaper readers rely on newspapers for health information and perceive such information as beneficial to their health and general health behavior. However, the newspapers have not provided the much-needed attention to the health sector. Media organizations should sponsor health reporters for training and improve their conditions of service, with favorable policies that prioritize the coverage of health issues, including sickle cell disorder, in the country.</p>
            
                <p>Given the enduring nature of newspapers and their potential impact on readers, it is crucial for newspapers to strategically give prominent attention to the coverage of sickle cell disorder and other health issues affecting the socio-economic life of Nigeria. This can be achieved through lead stories, front-page coverage, editorials, and other important sections of newspapers. Newspapers, like other mass media, can play a significant role in setting the health agenda, influencing the health behaviors of individuals in the Nigerian public and the health sector at large.</p>
