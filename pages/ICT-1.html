            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Pharmacy management system is designed to improve the accuracy, enhance safety, and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. It is a computer-based system that helps the Pharmacist to improve inventory management, cost, medical safety, etc.</p>
                
                <p>Pharmacy management system was developed to ensure the security of information and reliability of Pharmacy records when accessing and providing services to the customers. The information gathered during the data collection was properly analyzed and the results provided the basis for the new system. The system was tested and found to be functional, and the outputs produced by this system were encouraging. The application will hence reduce the loss of information unlike the existing system and also information will be processed fast.</p>

                <p>Effective implementation of this software will take care of the basic requirements of the pharmacy management system because it is capable of providing easy and effective storage of information related to activities happening in the stipulated area. With these, the objectives of the system design will be achieved.</p>
                
                <p>In order to allow for future expansion, the system has been designed in such a way that will allow possible modification as it may deem necessary by the pharmacy management, whenever the idea arises.</p>
