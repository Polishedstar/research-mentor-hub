            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In a nutshell, it is necessary to recall or refer to chapter four, where this summary is drawn. It is noticed that out of the two hypotheses formulated using some questionnaires, the alternative hypothesis is accepted (Hi).</p>
                <p>After analyzing the data and presenting it in tables, it is ascertained that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Management's action is a contributory factor that affects organizations. Reference to table 11 of chapter four above where 82.6% of the respondents agreed that management's action affects the staff and causes a high rate of labor turnover.</li>
                    <li>In a similar vein, table 4 also has it that workers leave the organization, i.e., Grand Cereals and Oil Mills Limited, for higher earnings in other organizations.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Finally, it is a clear indicator that the management of the organization has not been given proper attention to the problems that cause high turnover of employees, which affects their productivity.</p>
                <p>From the data collected and analyzed, this research work will be concluded by restating the fact that labor turnover has adversely affected the efficiency and stability of organizations due to the lukewarm attitude of management towards checking the evils of labor turnover thoroughly and also the instability of management to formulate and implement strategies that could check the trend effectively (e.g., the upward review of staff salaries, motivation, and job satisfaction).</p>
                <p>Finally, based on the above findings and foregoing analysis, it could be submitted here that the aims and objectives of this study have been achieved.</p>
