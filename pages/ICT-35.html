            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study shows that the following factors contribute to the challenges in teaching and learning shorthand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of interest in shorthand</li>
                    <li>Perception of shorthand being difficult</li>
                    <li>Computer-based subjects taking precedence over shorthand</li>
                    <li>Suggestions to remove shorthand from the syllabus</li>
                    <li>Nonchalant attitude of students</li>
                    <li>Large population of students in class</li>
                    <li>Lack of adequate instructional equipment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lack of interest in shorthand is a problem in the teaching and learning of shorthand, as observed through questionnaire responses. Respondents expressed a preference for improving their knowledge of shorthand.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the lack of adequate teaching equipment is a challenge. When a teacher cannot clearly and confidently illustrate to students during teaching, it becomes difficult to impart knowledge optimally. When learners do not show a favorable attitude towards learning the course, it remains problematic.</p>
