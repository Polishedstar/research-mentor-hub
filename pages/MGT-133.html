            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In the course of the study, some facts were established based on findings and the analysis of such findings. From the facts presented in table (5) drawn from responses to question (5), 79.41% admitted that the success of other products within the organization's product mix is attributed to marketing research.</p>
                <p>Likewise in table (6), 88.24% of respondents' opinions show that the absence of marketing research is responsible for the failure of new products. Therefore, it is very essential and vital to adopt marketing research in introducing new products into the market.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, it was also ascertained from table (8) where 88.24% of the respondents were of the opinion that marketing research will improve the success of new products. Similarly, in table (9), the respondents confirm that proper marketing research by an organization is an effective tool for product development. In table (10), 76.47% admitted that adopting marketing research will guarantee the growth and survival of an organization.</p>
                <p>From the analysis, the two alternative hypotheses (Hi) were accepted while the null hypothesis (Ho) is rejected. By accepting the alternative hypothesis, it is obvious that marketing research is an effective tool for product development as far as business settings and organizations are concerned.</p>
                <p>The dynamic nature of the business environment today makes it necessary to carry out research before making a decision. It is most relevant in decisions that involve the production of goods and services for an entire population.</p>
                <p>Businesses that have failed today mostly did not adhere to the marketing research principle, which left them unable to compete favorably and satisfy market demand. In this regard, the importance of marketing research as a tool for new product development cannot be overemphasized because it ensures the birth and survival of products offered to a target market.</p>
