            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This study was carried out to examine the role of local government in rural development with a view to finding out its impact on grassroots/rural development. The study was conducted in Jos South Local government and its constituent communities. The study has three main objectives which were specifically to;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ascertain whether Jos South local government has contributed substantially to rural development.</li>
                    <li>Finding out if inadequacy of skilled workers (like qualified engineers of all types, medical doctors, etc) has any effect on the ability of Jos South local government council in carrying out rural development programs.</li>
                    <li>Verifying whether inadequate financing by both state and federal governments hinders the council in carrying out developmental programs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The study was anchored on the "system theory" of David Easton. The theory argues that in every system, which includes a political system, there are subsystems making up the entire system. These subsystems are assigned functions and provided with enabling empowerment, including resources, appropriate authority, etc. to enable them to discharge their responsibilities optimally.</p>
                <p>The method adopted in this study is a triangulation of survey and descriptive analysis, which provided general impressions, a summary of observations, and findings made from the data collected. The methodology provided tools for the analysis of the impact of local government on grassroots development with Jos South Local government area as a case study.</p>
                <p>Generally, it could be seen that Jos South local government has not been effective in the development of rural communities. The conclusion reveals that rural development is inadequately carried out in the local government area. For instance, with the exception of the local government headquarters and a few other communities, most are not electrified, and the possibilities of embarking on these projects are very remote. This has slowed down some other projects like cottage industries, and pipe-borne water is equally in short supply in the local government area. The council has not performed well in the provision of medical facilities, as most of the communities in the famine areas travel far for medical services.</p>
                <p>The council has performed below expectations in the provision and maintenance of primary schools in the area. In some communities, pupils provide their own desks with which to sit and learn. The council fails to utilize its manpower in carrying out projects and rather prefers the use of contractors who give kickbacks. Finance is the bedrock of every business and government, and it is evident that the council lacks the seriousness in the pursuance of internally generated revenue, relying mostly on the Federal and State allocation, which is not enough even to pay workers' salaries.</p>
