            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research work was aimed at determining the impact of physical distribution channels in marketing of agricultural produce: a case study of Jos South Local Government Area, being the focal point. In the course of the research, therefore, a number of findings were made which are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Farmers convey their products directly to the manufacturers and consumers.</li>
                    <li>That channel of distribution hinders farmers to convey their agricultural product to accessible markets.</li>
                    <li>The study portrayed that lack of storage facilities of agricultural produce in the area hinders preservation of food during the harvest period.</li>
                    <li>It was deduced that bad road networks discourage farmers to produce more due to poor means to convey foodstuffs to other areas.</li>
                    <li>That policies made by government regulating agencies partially affect agriculture in that area.</li>
                    <li>It was learnt from the study that there are many distribution channels in the areas for farmers to convey their produce to the market.</li>
                    <li>The study revealed that a good and accessible road is an aid to improve the channel of distributing farm produce.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered that the cost of transportation, type of product, and customer/target market influence the selection of the distribution channel.</li>
                    <li>That customers'/consumers' location influences efficient distribution of farm produce.</li>
                    <li>That the lack of adequate physical distribution facilities leads to the spoilage of farm products before getting to their destination points.</li>
                    <li>The study further revealed that the channel of distribution contributes to the effective marketing of agricultural products and profitability of the organization.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the aforementioned findings and empirical test of the research study, the researcher concludes that physical distribution, as one of the major components of the marketing mix, has a vital role to play in the marketing of agricultural products in the area.</p>
                <p>This is because the goods produced must not be wasted, the farmers' labor must be encouraged as the consumers and customers at different places need these agricultural produce either as raw materials, semi-finished, or finished products for production.</p>
