            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The objective of this study, as stated earlier, was to identify:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How the marketing function of Ketchups Hotel and leisure is performed.</li>
                    <li>The extent to which it has affected its profitability.</li>
                    <li>To examine and evaluate the various marketing techniques and tools employed by it, with a view to measuring their effectiveness on the overall performance of the Hotel.</li>
                    <li>To recommend where necessary, strategies for improving or rectifying areas of weakness.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The researcher commenced by giving a brief introduction and review of the relevant literature on the topical area. Marketing was looked into, both as a business function and as a business philosophy, followed by an examination of the major characteristics of (Hospitality) services, the marketing concept, Hotel marketing objectives, and the marketing of Hospitality/Hotel services in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>This researcher then proceeded to highlight and design a protocol for data collection and analysis, the scope and limitation of the study. This was followed by a brief spell on Ketchups Hotels and leisure and its marketing organization.</p>
                <p>Finally, after data collection and analysis, the findings were briefly summarized.</p>
                <p>As opined by Nwankwo, as the economy expands and develops, old horizons will unfold and new opportunities and challenges will open up, and the environment will have no room for the stagnant Hotelier, hamstrung with age-old traditions. The day will be carried by the progressive and dynamic Hotelier who is always improving his skills, constantly scanning the environment and identifying customers' needs and by so doing manages his resources to meet diverse and competing priorities. This cannot be possible without effective marketing.</p>
                <p>Understanding the financial environment or responding successfully to the resultant competitive influence will increasingly differentiate the successful institution from the pans. This exemplifies the so-called "failure" or success syndrome. Successful policies in the past may not work in the same manner when conditions change. Of course, this does not mean that more traditional Hoteling strengths and policies are now redundant. But traditional strengths must be exploited in a way that is appropriate to new conditions and technological developments.</p>
                <p>Ketchups Hotels and leisure seems to have come to terms with this fact even from inception. It has involved a marketing culture that transcends and permeates every nook and cranny of the organization. The Hotel has financial and technical resources, innovative ability, the determination to provide customers with the required services, the expertise for sophisticated and intricate financial operations, and a well-developed armory of skill and technology which management of a modern institution of this nature calls for. All these have culminated in the excellent overall performance by the Hotel.</p>
