            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The study revealed that there is a significant relationship between human resource training and organizational performance in the Nigerian police force Plateau State Command Jos.</p>
                <p>It was discovered that human resource training development enhances the efficient performance of workers or staff in the Nigerian police force.</p>
                <p>The study revealed that the organization emphasizes more on human resource training and development. It was discovered that most categories of staff are usually considered for training and development programs of the Nigerian police force to improve their skills in carrying out their duties to minimize crime in society.</p>
                <p>From the study, it can be concluded that manpower training and development result in efficient performance of organizations in terms of increasing workers' output and providing a framework for the growth and development of the organization as a whole.</p>
                <p>However, only a few staff in the junior cadre of public organizations are often recommended for training due to poor managerial support, inadequate funding evaluation, bias rating, and low profile of government in the sponsorship of manpower training and development, respectively.</p>
