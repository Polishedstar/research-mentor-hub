            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Libraries enhance the productivity of individuals and organizations. Access to the right information is a critical component of the productivity of information workers and, consequently, the productivity and decision-making of the organizations employing them. Availability of information resources is another factor that can affect the use of a library. However, it can sometimes happen that materials available are not accessible. The impact of a library can be significantly felt by users only if the materials are accessible to them. Availability of information resources does not necessarily mean accessibility, let alone their use.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that it is not enough for a given establishment to have adequate information resources; they must be made accessible for effective utilization or consultation. It is in this regard that this study was undertaken to assess the availability and accessibility of information resources at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies in Kuru, Plateau State.</p>
                <p>In the preceding chapters, an attempt was made to evaluate the information resources at the institute's special library. Consequently, questionnaires were administered to select samples, and responses were analyzed.</p>
                <p>Among the conclusions drawn from the research undertaking are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The library's collections cut across various disciplines, with more print materials than electronic materials.</li>
                    <li>Most of the users have high academic qualifications and are also professionals.</li>
                    <li>The library's services are not biased by nationality; users are sponsored from various sectors of society, including government, corporate, and self-sponsored.</li>
                    <li>Books, both local and foreign, newspapers, and journal publications are the most frequently requested materials.</li>
                    <li>The library is at the level of library automation, with limited availability and use of computers.</li>
                    <li>The numerical strength of the staff is adequate, and most of them are qualified.</li>
                    <li>The internet and current awareness services are grossly inadequate.</li>
                </ul>
