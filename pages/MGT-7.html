            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Chapter one had its main focus on the general introduction of the subject of the study. Leadership was introduced, and the need to adopt a multi-style by leaders in the wake of growing complexity in organizations was also pinpointed. Questions and objectives of the study were posed in the chapter to help drive the conduct of the research. Other sections of the chapter also highlight one or two necessary facts about the direction and focus of the research work.</p>
                <p>Chapter two essentially focused on the review of relevant literature that shares the same aim of the research subject, and several sections were created under this chapter to make a thorough review of important literatures and explaining variables related to the topic. Furthermore, an attempt was made to formulate important and accurate theoretical framework that best explains "An evaluation of small-scale business as a catalyst for economic development, Jos city plateau state" as such theoretical assumptions of the path-goal theory were used to drive the conduct of the research.</p>
                <p>Chapter three focused on a very important aspect of a good research work, i.e., the methodological perspective used in the study. It also shed light on the research settings adopted by the study and highlighted the means through which data was generated to enable valid prediction for the study.</p>
                <p>Chapter four comprised data analysis and interpretation of the gathered data for the research work and were illustrated in a tabular form interpretations were made below. Therein, the study concluded that leaders who adopt a democratic style of leadership have a significant effect on employees' attitude, and the employees are satisfied with their job.</p>
