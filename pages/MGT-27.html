            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the responses obtained from the questions under analysis, the researcher has come to the conclusion that small-scale enterprises create a positive impact on the growth and development of a nation's economy.</p>
                <p>In the course of this research, the researcher realizes some positive effects of small-scale enterprises in the creation of a positive impact on the economy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>(a) Small-scale enterprises contribute to the economic growth and development of Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>(b) Small-scale enterprises have a strong impact on the nation's Gross Domestic Product and contribute to a variety of products for consumers in the marketplace.</li>
                    <li>(c) Small-scale businesses are significantly contributing to employment creation and are also used as a tool to alleviate poverty in Nigeria.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the past chapters, the researcher has tried to examine the impact of small-scale enterprises on the growth and development of a nation's economy. The researcher also looked at how they have been contributing and also the problems associated with small-scale business in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>With the Impact of Small-Scale Business (SSB), at least, an increasing number of graduates from various institutions who roam the streets seeking placement in a few declared vacancies can avail themselves of the opportunities available to make a living (Ogundele, 2006).</p>
                <p>According to CHIGBO (2014), the rebasing of the Gross Domestic Product, however, did not positively change the cost of living or standard of living in the country. What it does show is that the country's economy is being increasingly diversified as it has witnessed a structural shift.</p>
                <p>When small businesses improve in an economy, there is a tendency that, in the future, they can become large businesses, and this can be achievable if moral and financial support from government agencies is given.</p>
