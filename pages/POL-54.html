            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first finding indicates that the effectiveness and efficiency of a policy have to do with its flexibility, its ability to adjust to changing situations and the business environment. This finding also shows that the flexibility of a policy is very much indispensable for the growth of the organization and the positive relationship among all the members of the organization. The behaviors of management and employees are significantly influenced by policies, skills acting in situations, and full recognition of all employees in the organization system.</li>
                    <li>The second finding postulates that managerial policies have no monopoly of decision or authority. Respect for employees' rights, ruling with freedom, and improvement in interpersonal relationships are strong determinants of a positive reaction from employees in terms of their participation in decision-making and working to achieve organizational goals. This highlights the relationship between a particular management policy and the reaction of employees. Moreover, organizational behaviors of management and employees, either positive or negative, depend on situational variables. The use of rigid policies will elicit high negative behaviors on the part of employees.</li>
                    <li>The third finding, however, emphasizes the necessity of a positive relationship between management and organizational behaviors to increase work performance. It clearly states that whichever management policy is adopted, it has a related impact on organizational behaviors, which, in turn, will either increase or decrease work performance or productivity.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Management policies in relation to achieving organizational productivity are key subject matters in an organization. The management policy of an organization can influence organizational productivity, either positively or negatively, in the operation of the organization. A conducive atmosphere should be created, and a sense of belonging should be given to the employees in that organization. This will impact the organization's strengths and address any weaknesses.</p>
                <p>Organizational productivity is linked to employees' performance within an organization as they perform their individual functions. The manager directs their paths in which they are expected to work. This relationship forms a chain within the organization, which is interrelated with each other.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that no policy is perfect or the worst one, but policies vary as situations arise in the organization. Changes in some factors in the environment have the tendency to affect the organization's objectives. Every situation should go along with a policy that best salvages or remedies the problems at hand. A rigid policy is not advisable since change is constant and inevitable, bound to occur over time.</p>
