            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The internal audit is an independent execution within an organization for the review of financial accounts and other operations as the basis of services to the management.</p>
                <p>The internal audit is intended to assist all members of management in effectively discharging their responsibilities by providing goals, analysis, recommendations, and comments on the activities reviewed.</p>
                <p>The distinction between internal audit, internal checks, and internal control is that there cannot be an internal audit if there is no internal control in an organization. This is because internal control comprises the whole system of control of the organization, where internal audit and internal checks are but parts of the system.</p>
                <p>Internal and external auditing are similar except that internal auditing is for those who are members of professional bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN). With the growth in size and complexity of many organizations, the importance of internal audit has increased, and it is now a major factor in assessing an organization's internal control. Its development has made a considerable contribution to contemporary auditing practice.</p>
                <p>For the objectives of an internal audit department to be achieved, banks and other organizations should consider the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The internal audit should have a high degree of independence.</li>
                    <li>It should have access to records, assets, and personnel of the organization.</li>
                    <li>The activities of the organization should be divided in a way that allows officials to handle the process of transactions from the beginning to the end of financial records, and there should be a division of labor.</li>
                    <li>Finally, there should be no conflicting interests or restrictions placed upon the work of internal audit by the management.</li>
                </ol>
