            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The findings from the analysis have revealed numerous factors hindering the performance of time, cost, and quality in construction projects, resulting in poor construction work performance. The results indicate that inadequate budget and financial problems are the major factors affecting time performance in construction projects. Additionally, community problems, staff welfare, and the death of one of the parties to a contract also impact time performance.</p>
                
                <p>Regarding cost performance, the results show that an increase in the cost of materials is the major factor hindering cost performance in construction projects. Procurement of low-quality materials is the primary factor affecting quality performance. Client's intervention, inexperience, and the timeline of the construction work were also indicated as other factors hindering quality performance.</p>
                
                <p>The study has identified that the main effects of poor performance on construction projects include project abandonment, building collapses, and the blacklisting of contracting firms. The major criteria used to measure construction project performance are time, cost, and quality. However, satisfaction of all participants, including the client, the design and construction team, environmental performance, functionality, and health and safety, are subjective (soft) measures suggested as other performance criteria.</p>
                
                <p>The study has also pinpointed some measures to be adopted to increase the performance of construction projects in Akwa Ibom State. Adequate communication between clients, contractors, and consultants was identified as the major factor to be adopted. Selecting competent professionals to handle construction projects, setting performance targets, providing adequate funds for projects, eliminating politics in construction projects, and employing an effective leadership style were among the suggested measures that can improve and increase the performance of construction projects.</p>
