            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>From the above analysis, it was observed that there were more males compared to females. Ages were adequately compared, and marital statuses were completely analyzed.</p>
                <p>It was discovered that the volatility of the exchange rate in Nigeria has a significant impact on the country's economic growth and development.</p>
                <p>Regarding educational qualifications, it was also found that there were more graduates than undergraduates in the organization.</p>
                <p>It was further discovered that the services in the organization have a high capacity and are highly productive. The findings revealed the historical volatility of Nigeria's exchange rate and how foreign exchange rate policies have affected the country's economic growth.</p>
                <p>It was found that exchange rates have a positive impact on Nigeria's economic growth.</p>
                <p>In line with the scope and focus of the study, inflation, import, foreign direct investment, and exports are considered as proxies for foreign exchange management. Their alterations are expected to either stimulate or shrink economic growth. This expectation was confirmed by this study, indicating that Nigeria's economic growth can be positively influenced by effective foreign exchange management policies.</p>
                <p>Based on the findings, it is recommended that efforts should be made to increase the consumption of locally made Nigerian goods, including the use of raw materials that can be sourced within the country. This will help boost foreign exchange earnings. Local industries should be encouraged to seek raw materials domestically. The study revealed that the relationship between economic growth and foreign exchange management is a short-term one, so policy initiatives should address short-term behavioral expectations of the variables used in the study.</p>
