            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The research work was summarized based on the findings presented and analyzed in chapter four. The research work established that corruption is one of the challenges constraining sustainable development goals towards developing rural areas in Plateau State. This research finding also shows that the negative impact of youth unemployment on the economy is very high, as seen in the data analysis. Lastly, the research finding also shows that it was observed that the level of unemployment, overpopulation, corruption, lack of participation in agricultural farming, and tribalism in the community is still very high in Plateau State.</p>
                <p>The contemporary implication of the study is that it would not only examine the extent of the contribution of these instruments but also reawaken the examination of some other development instruments and their extent towards the actualization of conflict management and economic empowerment by Agenda 2030.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It was discovered during the study that conflict management can be resolved by creating awareness of the danger/effects of conflict to the people in Barkin Ladi local government area.</li>
                    <li>It is very certain and assuring that corruption, tribalism, and religious sentiment are major challenges to conflict management in Barkin Ladi local government by enhancing economic empowerment and conflict resolution in Barkin Ladi local government area.</li>
