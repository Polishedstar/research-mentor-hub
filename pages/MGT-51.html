            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Global economic meltdown has a negative impact on the performance of manufacturing industries, particularly Coca-Cola.</li>
                    <li>Coca-Cola plc witnessed a high increase in unsold stocks, an increase in bank rates, and charges as a result of the global economic meltdown.</li>
                    <li>The turnover of Coca-Cola and profit margin of 2005-2006 was higher than that of 2007-2010, which witnessed the effects of the global economic recession.</li>
                    <li>Just like most countries, the Nigerian economy suffered from the global economic meltdown, particularly the financial market and manufacturing.</li>
                    <li>Despite the global economic meltdown, businesses can still record huge success in their transactions through diversification of investment portfolios.</li>
                    <li>Potential manufacturers are discouraged from engaging in small-scale businesses during the economic meltdown period due to an increase in interest rates and bank charges.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on the findings of this work, the researcher can safely conclude that the global economic meltdown has a negative impact on the performance of manufacturing industries. We can also state that although businesses do not find it easy during economic meltdown periods, they can still record success in their transactions.</p>
