            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>In our present capitalist society whose economics depends on the exchange of goods and services, complaints, competitive advertising of products, and business powers the "engine of our economy, fostering economic growth and creating jobs in many industries" (Bran, 2017). Many practices and behaviors exist in our competitive market where the taste of consumers plays a vital role in the designing, pricing, production, and promotion of goods and services. Basically, the aim of this study has been to capture the influence of billboard advertising on product promotion. The study revealed that billboard advertising creates awareness of products and services, influences consumers' choice of products and services. Billboard advertising also contributes to the nation's environmental beautification and economic growth. This study also indicated that billboard advertising messages carry and reinforce electronic and print media messages.</p>
                <p>Based on the research conducted by the researcher, it revealed billboard advertising as one of the most important tools for product promotion. It is most suited for intensively distributed impulse goods bought by advertisers by brand name. According to the research being studied, there is no doubt that billboard advertising promotes products and services, creates awareness of product existence, especially newly introduced goods. Again, billboard generally influences consumer's decisions because it uses irresistible, simple, short, and easily understandable slogans that are easy to read and understand, making it viewer-friendly. However, billboard advertising should be patronized by advertisers because it does not contradict other advertising messages, thereby carrying the same message on products and services with radio and television, etc. Government should support billboard advertising because it contributes to economic growth and environmental beautification.</p>
