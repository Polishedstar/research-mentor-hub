            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>This chapter summarizes the whole research process and concludes with recommendations. A brief summary of the whole study is given. It also provides a summary of the main findings of the study, conclusions of the study, recommendations, and suggestions for further research pertinent to the impact of the Insurgency on socio-economic activities in Bassa Local Government Area, Nigeria. The study highlights the effects of Insurgency on socioeconomic activities in Bassa Local Government Area, Nigeria. Findings here show that several bodies such as Government, civil society organizations, Non-governmental organizations, security agencies, and traditional leaders have played some role in addressing the socioeconomic challenges and the insurgency as well. However, it shows that government has a larger role to play and should collaborate with other stakeholders locally and internationally to curb the menace.</p>
                
                <p>In this research work, various definitions are given, ranging from insurgency to socioeconomic activities. The role of government and their counterparts in addressing the negative impact of the Insurgency on socio-economic activities cannot be overemphasized. They play a significant role in maintaining the daily activities involving their contributions to socioeconomic development. Education and businesses are most affected and if not properly handled will create problems such as children not attending schools, businesses shutting down, and insecurity worsening. The study found that by being closer to the people and by virtue of the respect people have for the traditional institutions, the task of settling disputes, palliatives, military coordination, and psychosocial support has gone a long way in addressing some serious challenges facing the residents of the state while they conduct their socioeconomic activities.</p>
                
                <p>The government both at the federal and state levels has found it necessary to effectively use civil society/NGOs for promoting socioeconomic progress among the various communities. A lot of government programs are carried out with massive support of NGOs, traditional rulers, and security agencies in communities across the state through their enlightenment and mobilization drive. It is worthy of note that the majority of the individuals who lead the approaches to address socioeconomic development in Bassa Local Government Area are well-educated and experienced in administration, as they are from professional organizations. The experiences they acquire during their active years in services have placed them at a very good advantage as traditional rulers. However, there are certain challenges being faced by the traditional rulers, some of which have been highlighted in chapter four, and the recommendations are presented here in this chapter. Their roles should not be tampered with as they engage with communities to advocate for peace and other acts of good since they are respected by the residents.</p>
                
                <p>The study gives relevant insights to researchers, private organizations, civil society organizations, security agencies, and other stakeholders. The study showed other indicators that were not intended in the initiation of the study, especially with respect to contributions of civil society organizations and lack of government agencies. Moreover, it also showed that there are significant benefits from frameworks that seek to foster socioeconomic development, human capital development, and infrastructure.</p>
                
                <p>A definite finding from the study is that good governance needs to be entrenched to enhance the roles of traditional rulers, provision of employment opportunities, empowering the youths through skill acquisition, and provision of necessary infrastructure as the means of improving the socioeconomic activities and reducing the negative effects of the insurgency in the state. This is consistent with Ukiwo and Chukwuma (2012), both argued that governance deficiency and general insecurity in the region are inter-linked and mutually reinforcing.</p>
