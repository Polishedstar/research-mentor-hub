            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Effective reduction of poverty in Nigeria is a daunting task that seems to be a mirage as efforts so far exerted, instead of reducing the poverty level, aggravate it. However, with the establishment of NAPEP, the situation seems to have improved.</p>
                <p>The research findings clearly portrayed the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Before the establishment of National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP), there was a high incidence of poverty in Plateau State.</li>
                    <li>The following strategies for reducing poverty in Plateau State were identified in the course of the study:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Micro credits</li>
                            <li>Provision of infrastructure</li>
                            <li>Agricultural production</li>
                            <li>Capacity building</li>
                            <li>Healthcare delivery</li>
                            <li>Training of citizens for skill acquisition in the productive sector.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The following causes of poverty in Plateau State were also identified:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low economic growth performance</li>
                            <li>Macroeconomic shocks and policy failure</li>
                            <li>Labour markets deficiencies</li>
                            <li>Unemployment and underemployment</li>
                            <li>Human resource development and health/disease</li>
                            <li>Debt burden and governance</li>
                            <li>Environmental degradation</li>
                            <li>Crime and violence</li>
                            <li>Globalization, world trade order (WTO), and migration</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>An extensive review of literature was also undertaken while the main source of data collection was the questionnaire. Simple percentages form the basis of the analysis of the questionnaire, while the chi-square statistic at a 5% level of significance was used in analyzing the hypotheses.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The findings of this research have shown that the activities of the National Poverty Eradication Programmes (NAPEP) are felt in all the Local Governments Areas of the State. The program is found in both the rural and urban areas of the State. It is, however, left to the citizens of the State to take good advantage of this laudable project of the Federal Government.</p>
                <p>The poor for which this program is been established are willing to participate in its implementation, only that some of the stringent conditions for participation in the activities like "documentations and level of assistance" should be relaxed for more patronage from the citizens of the State. It was also discovered that the activities of the National Poverty Eradication Programmes (NAPEP) in the State have been successful going by the impact on the citizenry in the State.</p>
                <p>The Federal Government should try and fulfill its part by promptly releasing funds to the Agency for its smooth operations. This is because the major problem of this Program is funding, which is almost making nonsense of the Program. Honest and trustworthy individuals should be appointed at the helm of affairs to reduce the incidence of misappropriation of funds budgeted to the program.</p>
                <p>Poverty issues cannot effectively be addressed in isolation from social norms, values, and customary practices at different levels of the family, community, state, and Nigeria.</p>
                <p>The National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP) should be seen as an integral part of agencies responsible for the realization of good governance and the provision of basic social amenities, especially enhancing security and providing means of cushioning the vulnerability of the citizens to external and mostly uncontrollable events such as violence, economic shocks, natural disasters, etc.</p>
