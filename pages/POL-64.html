            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>The role of women's education towards development in our communities refers to giving women their right to function or participate fully in any program that can move the local government forward. In some societies, women are considered as pillars of our communities, and they have the right to suggest and decide on how to rule matters.</p>
                <p>This research work attempts to discover the fundamental problems that affect the role of women in many ways. The problems, which stand as barriers to the effective performance of their functions, include, among others, the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of funds</li>
                    <li>Lack of trust among the officials</li>
                    <li>Religious rivalry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Furthermore, this research discovered that the impact of the role of women in service provision is most felt in rural areas than in urban areas due to the fact that rural areas lack social services such as health, education, housing, electricity, water supply, mass transit, etc.</p>
                <p>The research work also reveals that the performance of women will never be changed by the government because they have a strong foundation that will support them fully. We have federal ministries of women affairs, we have them at the state level down to the local government.</p>
                <p>The role of women's education towards development in the provision of services can never be overemphasized in developing countries like Nigeria, with particular reference to Langtang South Local Government Area.</p>
