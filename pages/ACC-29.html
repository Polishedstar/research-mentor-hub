            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>After all the processes of carrying out the research have been concluded, we present here our findings:</p>
                <p><strong>Banking Sectors have an impact on Nigerian economic growth and development.</strong></p>
                <p>Other findings are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a relationship between economic growth and the Nigerian Banking Sectors.</li>
                    <li>The Banking Sector plays various roles in Nigerian economic growth and development, ranging from inculcating banking habits, mobilizing savings for investment purposes, channeling resources from surplus economic units to deficit economic units for investment purposes, to assisting the government in the implementation of monetary and credit policies, and providing short-term and long-term credits to the public sector.</li>
                    <li>The Banking Sectors contributed a lot to Nigerian Economic Growth and Development, including inculcating banking habits, mobilizing savings for investment purposes, channeling resources from surplus economic units to deficit economic units for investment purposes, assisting the government in the implementation of monetary and credit policies, and providing short-term and long-term credits to the public sector.</li>
                    <li>That the Banking sectors positively affect the economic growth and development in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>The reasons why Banking Sectors have not been able to achieve the expected results for the development of the economy are tied to the following:</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poor asset quality</li>
                    <li>Undercapitalization</li>
                    <li>Poor corporate governance</li>
                    <li>Low level of financial growth</li>
                    <li>Operation at a level lower than that which could deliver competitive return on equity.</li>
                    <li>Poor risk management practice</li>
                    <li>Poor quality service and diversified delivery channels.</li>
                    <li>Diseconomies of scale of operation.</li>
                    <li>Thin spread of qualified and experienced manpower.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Last, leakages in control systems are being minimized through increased monitoring of banking activities and efforts have been made to increase the number of instruments and operators in the money market.</p>
