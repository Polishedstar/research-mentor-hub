            <h2>Findings of the Research Work</h2>
                <p>Conflict can only be seen when the government is not taking the interest of the public at heart. In Nigeria, it is seen that good governance will enhance conflict prevention, which is identified as the best way of conflict resolution. It is also important that innovation and transformation in communication, collaboration, dialogue, conciliation, mediation, and proper crisis management are equally needed to resolve conflict to achieve sustainable development in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>As inferred from the study, conflict management is the process of limiting the negative aspects of conflict while increasing its positive aspects. It is the principle that all conflicts cannot necessarily be resolved, but learning how to manage conflicts can decrease the odds of nonproductive escalation. Transformation of conflict is also very expedient for turning conflicts into the basis of future cooperation among social entities.</p>
                <p>Conflicts are part of human nature, and it is extremely important to study them not only for theoretical purposes but also for developmental purposes. Conflict analysis and its resolution have an important role in private, public, and political organizations, as well as in judicial and work disputes, in military operations</p>
